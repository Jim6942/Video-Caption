1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,014
How you going? You know what's always annoyed me about being Australian, and everyone around

2
00:00:04,052 --> 00:00:07,726
the world keeps making fun of us for it. That we don't have

3
00:00:07,748 --> 00:00:11,390
the ability to shoot fast projectiles out of a moving vehicle.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,262
But today I finally can, as Clash of clans asked me to make this

5
00:00:15,316 --> 00:00:18,778
expo from the game that can shoot a two kilo arrow

6
00:00:18,874 --> 00:00:22,320
over 600ft, all while moving on top of my car.

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,998
Alright, it turns out I'm not the first to do a sponsorship for Clash of

8
00:00:27,004 --> 00:00:30,786
clans. And ancient civilizations like the Romans and French copied

9
00:00:30,818 --> 00:00:34,774
the expos from the game and made them out of wood using primitive technology.

10
00:00:34,892 --> 00:00:38,520
But they had a funny way of pronouncing expos. They called them

11
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,346
blisters. And I was going to copy their designs, but as far as

12
00:00:42,368 --> 00:00:45,866
I can tell, they were really, really tiny and I want

13
00:00:45,888 --> 00:00:49,494
something bigger and more impressive. Also, I've decided I'm not going to copy

14
00:00:49,542 --> 00:00:52,986
anything about their designs, as the Romans were all idiots. And I've

15
00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:56,254
got something they didn't access to spearfishing stores that

16
00:00:56,292 --> 00:00:59,722
stock overpowered rubber bands made in factories in Shenzhen.

17
00:00:59,786 --> 00:01:03,610
The Romans did, however, have access to beards and massive

18
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,338
parties, which I don't. So we'll find out if that affects its performance.

19
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:10,802
So this is the plan. The rubbers will run along the side of this square

20
00:01:10,856 --> 00:01:14,770
tube, and I'll have some bearings on the front which the rubbers will come over

21
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,254
and then get pulled to the back with a winch which has a quick release,

22
00:01:18,302 --> 00:01:21,126
which I made in my last video. Now, the point of these bearings on the

23
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:24,262
front is that if I just had the rubbers tied to the front of the

24
00:01:24,316 --> 00:01:28,070
expo, they would only start providing pull force to the arrow here.

25
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,746
But with the bearings, you can pretension the rubbers and allow them to speed

26
00:01:31,778 --> 00:01:34,922
up the arrow until the very end of the muzzle. So we should get

27
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:38,266
more power. But I also don't know. So the first thing I did

28
00:01:38,288 --> 00:01:41,706
was turn down this big block of aluminium in the lathe and cut it

29
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:44,982
into these housings for the bearings, which are less comfortable

30
00:01:45,046 --> 00:01:48,782
than the houses they are used to living in. But now the bearings nicely fit

31
00:01:48,836 --> 00:01:51,854
the rubbers. Then I just put them onto the side of the rail. Next,

32
00:01:51,892 --> 00:01:55,082
I attached the winch on the back and I went for a hand winch

33
00:01:55,146 --> 00:01:58,434
as it feels more historically accurate, and I like the noise it

34
00:01:58,472 --> 00:02:02,034
makes and being able to feel the tension of the rubbers getting harder and

35
00:02:02,072 --> 00:02:05,714
harder to pull back, and the suspense of each click bringing me

36
00:02:05,752 --> 00:02:08,790
closer to the rubbers snapping and taking out my eye,

37
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,674
which I just wouldn't get with an electric winch. And you've probably noticed

38
00:02:14,722 --> 00:02:18,150
that the frame is already painted and you haven't actually seen me

39
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,886
weld anything together or make anything. I'm just re welding

40
00:02:21,938 --> 00:02:25,914
over welds. And, you know, in that previous shot of me turning down

41
00:02:25,952 --> 00:02:29,338
the housing for the bearings in the lathe, that was a lie as well.

42
00:02:29,424 --> 00:02:32,758
And it was actually just a can of beans in my lathe.

43
00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:36,126
And I just lied to you. Again, it wasn't even beans. It was actually a

44
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:39,086
can of tomatoes. But why do I keep lying to you?

45
00:02:39,188 --> 00:02:41,854
And you might be thinking, I'm doing this because I don't want to show you

46
00:02:41,892 --> 00:02:45,326
the horrible conditions that the three children that actually made this

47
00:02:45,348 --> 00:02:48,466
frame work in. But that's not it either. It's because making stuff like

48
00:02:48,488 --> 00:02:51,918
this always takes so long and is relatively boring. So my mate

49
00:02:51,934 --> 00:02:54,820
and I actually made all of this and just didn't record it.

50
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,198
And now, in an attempt to make this whole video longer and show the process

51
00:03:00,284 --> 00:03:03,078
on camera, I'm just doing extra unnecessary work.

52
00:03:03,164 --> 00:03:06,838
So next, I just pretended to do some more welds, and now comes the

53
00:03:06,844 --> 00:03:10,006
really hard part where I need to pretend to make the whole bottom half of

54
00:03:10,028 --> 00:03:13,820
my frame that attaches to my car, which my mate Rowan already made.

55
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,026
And now it's done. Well, functionally done. It needs to look more like

56
00:03:18,048 --> 00:03:21,434
the expo from Clash of Clans. But first, I really wanted to do some

57
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,698
test shots to find out if this even works in my yard in the

58
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:28,282
middle of a populated suburban city. And for anyone that's about to write a comment

59
00:03:28,346 --> 00:03:31,646
getting angry at me that I'm testing a ballista in a populated area, let me

60
00:03:31,668 --> 00:03:35,022
just remind you that I have a ballista that may or may not

61
00:03:35,076 --> 00:03:38,734
work. So we decided to test it first with one rubber

62
00:03:38,782 --> 00:03:41,954
in an attempt to build up suspense. But first, to build up even

63
00:03:41,992 --> 00:03:44,978
more suspense, I'm going to tell you a little bit more about the sponsor of

64
00:03:44,984 --> 00:03:48,590
the video. Clash of Clans. An ongoing event, Clash for nature.

65
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,486
Clash of Clans is a super fun strategy game where you build defenses, upgrade your

66
00:03:52,508 --> 00:03:55,750
base, and attack other players. And since I announced that I'm in the event,

67
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,680
everyone has been raiding my base non stop,

68
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,794
who keeps killing all my guys, and I

69
00:04:02,832 --> 00:04:06,506
keep losing, and people keep raiding me. Clash of Clans has an

70
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,866
ongoing event named Clash for Nature, which is almost reaching the

71
00:04:09,888 --> 00:04:13,706
end and will be having a significant update coming up right after the

72
00:04:13,728 --> 00:04:17,546
release of Town Hall 16. In Clash for nature, there are two teams. The charity's

73
00:04:17,578 --> 00:04:21,098
team trees or Team seas. And if you see my last video, you'll know I'm

74
00:04:21,114 --> 00:04:24,634
on Team trees. All your ingame actions during the event will lead to planting

75
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:27,798
trees and removing trash from the ocean in real life. Any of you can join

76
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,946
the event right now, even if you haven't played Clash of Clans before, you just

77
00:04:30,968 --> 00:04:34,466
scan my QR code, and then you get gold through multiplayer battles and

78
00:04:34,488 --> 00:04:37,650
looting other players'bases. Just don't loot my base,

79
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,094
please. And whichever creator and community that loots the most gold will win

80
00:04:41,132 --> 00:04:45,074
a Tesla and other prizes. And I'm currently ranked fourth in the Clash for nature

81
00:04:45,122 --> 00:04:47,878
event. And if we win, I'll get a bunch of prizes I can give to

82
00:04:47,884 --> 00:04:50,854
you guys. Also, I just want to stop Papa Plate from winning,

83
00:04:50,902 --> 00:04:55,046
so go download Clash of Clans now. Okay, back to the test of the expo

84
00:04:55,078 --> 00:04:56,250
with one rubber.

85
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,446
Ready? Three, two,

86
00:05:10,628 --> 00:05:11,360
one.

87
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,614
That sucks. And that was not very impressive.

88
00:05:17,662 --> 00:05:21,678
So we put on another rubber, and I also forgot how to do countdowns.

89
00:05:21,774 --> 00:05:23,460
Much harder to pull back.

90
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:34,120
3232,

91
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,822
how was that? And that looks significantly quicker, which is good,

92
00:05:38,876 --> 00:05:42,134
as it's going to be even faster with a third rubber. So we put that

93
00:05:42,172 --> 00:05:45,434
on and also attempted to shoot it through the chronograph so we can get some

94
00:05:45,472 --> 00:05:49,018
speed readings and then compare it to the Romans. And we can also compare it

95
00:05:49,024 --> 00:05:52,478
to the speed of the Expo and Clash of Clans, which looks like it's going

96
00:05:52,564 --> 00:05:53,520
very fast.

97
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,040
Oh, you need to turn the chronograph on.

98
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,480
Hold on. Yeah, point it.

99
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,418
Turn it on. Ready?

100
00:06:08,504 --> 00:06:09,780
Three, two.

101
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,874
And that was way slower than I was expecting. The maximum speed we got

102
00:06:15,912 --> 00:06:18,946
was 22 meters a second. And apparently the Roman ballisters could

103
00:06:18,968 --> 00:06:22,466
shoot a 400 grams bolt at 90 meters a second. The bolt

104
00:06:22,498 --> 00:06:25,926
that we're shooting weighs two kilos, though. So I cut it down. So it

105
00:06:25,948 --> 00:06:29,402
weighed 400 grams and gave it another go, which might make it five times

106
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:30,250
faster.

107
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,740
One,

108
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:38,780
three.

109
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:47,654
2136.6.

110
00:06:47,712 --> 00:06:51,006
And my first shot was 36 meters a second, but I think I know how

111
00:06:51,028 --> 00:06:54,654
to make it faster. You know what I said earlier about Romans having an advantage

112
00:06:54,702 --> 00:06:57,746
because they have beards and engage in other activities? So I

113
00:06:57,768 --> 00:06:59,890
thought my mate Rowan should have a shot.

114
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,440
Put your face shield down.

115
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,520
Thank you.

116
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,614
And Rowan's was suspiciously faster than my shot at 38 meters or

117
00:07:16,652 --> 00:07:20,086
130ft/second and that's not 90 meters a

118
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:23,606
second fast like the Romans. But it's still pretty good considering

119
00:07:23,638 --> 00:07:26,886
the Roman ballistas that achieved those speeds had a draw weight

120
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:30,634
of 5000 pounds, while our Expo's draw weight is only around

121
00:07:30,672 --> 00:07:34,094
500 pounds. Don't ask me how that's possible. I really don't know.

122
00:07:34,132 --> 00:07:38,298
But then I realized something. How did the Romans know how fast they were shooting?

123
00:07:38,474 --> 00:07:42,160
They didn't have chronographs or Gavin from the slow Mo guys,

124
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,562
so I think all the Romans were lying. And the same with the French.

125
00:07:45,706 --> 00:07:48,978
Especially the French. Okay, now it's time to

126
00:07:48,984 --> 00:07:52,418
make this look like the level ten Expo from Clash of clans, which we

127
00:07:52,424 --> 00:07:56,078
did by covering it in foam. And this may surprise some of you because you're

128
00:07:56,094 --> 00:08:00,182
stupid, but these limbs here don't do anything. Neither does this foam on the front

129
00:08:00,236 --> 00:08:02,070
or this aesthetic string.

130
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:07,558
Sorry. That does. And now you're probably looking at this and thinking,

131
00:08:07,644 --> 00:08:11,302
Alex, which is my name? This looks a bit like the level ten

132
00:08:11,356 --> 00:08:15,034
Expo from Clash of clans, but how is it going to shoot magical bolts and

133
00:08:15,072 --> 00:08:18,602
auto lock onto targets and then auto reload, like in the game?

134
00:08:18,656 --> 00:08:22,058
Well, it's not. That wasn't in my budget. And also, that's impossible. And you were

135
00:08:22,064 --> 00:08:25,162
just going to have to play the game to see that happen. It will hopefully

136
00:08:25,226 --> 00:08:28,734
still shoot and look really cool, though. Okay. I think

137
00:08:28,772 --> 00:08:32,046
my neighbors are preparing for siege warfare, so it's time to take it out to

138
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:35,586
Hamilton's farm and do some real tests. Also, this is

139
00:08:35,608 --> 00:08:39,582
obvious, but anyone watching, especially people living in syracuse

140
00:08:39,646 --> 00:08:43,314
in the fourth century BC, don't put an expo on your car or

141
00:08:43,352 --> 00:08:46,182
try any of this at home. And we're going to do a couple of different

142
00:08:46,236 --> 00:08:50,066
tests, like a penetration test on this car door that I stole from an undercover

143
00:08:50,098 --> 00:08:53,926
cop car. And also shoot this historically accurate Spartan suit of

144
00:08:53,948 --> 00:08:54,630
armor.

145
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,346
And this armor is a good test. As in the game, the expo can be

146
00:09:02,368 --> 00:09:05,866
used against troops like Pekka, this giant guy in a suit of

147
00:09:05,888 --> 00:09:09,338
armor. Then we'll have a distance test and an accuracy test,

148
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:12,734
and then finally a drive by test, and whoever gets the most

149
00:09:12,772 --> 00:09:16,160
points wins. Something I haven't decided yet.

150
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,918
Ron, do you think we should do a range test first?

151
00:09:20,004 --> 00:09:23,562
Yeah. See? Distance. Yeah. Okay. It's a good way to lose a bolt.

152
00:09:23,626 --> 00:09:26,558
Yeah, but then at least. And then we only have to shoot two. Yeah.

153
00:09:26,644 --> 00:09:30,386
Perfect. It's great. And also, if we do a destruction test first, we might up

154
00:09:30,408 --> 00:09:32,260
the bolts. We might destroy them.

155
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,538
I was going to say we can have a competition, but it won't really be

156
00:09:35,544 --> 00:09:38,222
a competition, because it's just going to be who can wind it back the furthest

157
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,654
and tilt it at the lowest angle. Exactly. All right,

158
00:09:41,692 --> 00:09:44,194
let's do it. Okay. First, I wanted to know how far it can shoot,

159
00:09:44,242 --> 00:09:47,240
so we loaded up the small bolt to do a distance test.

160
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,450
Face shield. That's what I forgot. I almost brought some fencing helmets.

161
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:55,606
Maybe I should put this on. I should, then. I can't see. No, you put

162
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,640
it on. No, I'm not putting it on. Okay.

163
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,440
All it's going to keep my face away from it.

164
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:11,600
God. Three, two.

165
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:15,140
Holy. Two.

166
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,090
Holy.

167
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,946
That was pretty good. That was pretty good. The Fletching was weird, and that

168
00:10:22,968 --> 00:10:26,318
acted really weirdly in the air with the duct tape fletching

169
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:29,446
that I put on. And also one of the rubbers snapped, but even with that,

170
00:10:29,468 --> 00:10:32,498
it went over 120 meters or 300ft.

171
00:10:32,594 --> 00:10:36,120
So we put on another rubber and took off the Fletching and tried again.

172
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:50,460
321211.

173
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,782
Similar distance. And I thought that flew a similar

174
00:10:56,836 --> 00:11:00,542
distance, but it turns out it flew a lot further at around 160

175
00:11:00,596 --> 00:11:04,190
meters or 520ft, but that was measured by my

176
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,646
steps and I am slightly biased. And also, the steepest angle

177
00:11:07,678 --> 00:11:11,314
I could get the expo to was, like, 15 degrees because of

178
00:11:11,352 --> 00:11:14,686
how I attached it to the car. So if it was at 45 degrees,

179
00:11:14,718 --> 00:11:17,958
the bolt would go much further. So now we're going to try the expo up

180
00:11:17,964 --> 00:11:21,414
against some targets and see what it does. And Rowan was up

181
00:11:21,452 --> 00:11:22,040
first.

182
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:31,114
Yeah, it's comfy up here. See, our point system we're going for

183
00:11:31,152 --> 00:11:34,870
here. What's worth the most? So there's three of us shooting.

184
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:38,666
I think if you pierce the armor, you get

185
00:11:38,688 --> 00:11:42,526
three points. If you just pierce a mannequin, you get one point.

186
00:11:42,628 --> 00:11:46,378
If you miss, you get minus one. And if you get through the car door,

187
00:11:46,554 --> 00:11:50,606
four. Okay, so you can just choose. What were

188
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:53,600
those points again? Points again. Don't ask me that.

189
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,620
It can't hit me if you aim it down to me right now. Right.

190
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,374
What are you aiming for? I'm going for the door. He's going for the door.

191
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:06,600
He's a four pointer. Or maybe I want the Roman. I don't know.

192
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,280
There it is.

193
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:14,600
I have no idea. Three, two,

194
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:15,800
one.

195
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:29,206
I missed. And he didn't account for the drop of the heavy

196
00:12:29,238 --> 00:12:33,406
bolts and shot low in between their legs. So he's on zero points.

197
00:12:33,508 --> 00:12:36,590
And next was Alexa. Can you open this door,

198
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,070
Mulaney?

199
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,820
Yes. That's exactly what I wanted.

200
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:51,220
This feels amazing. Yeah, this feels so good.

201
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,640
And I feel awesome just being at the. Yeah,

202
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:01,142
I feel so powerful right now. I'm going to go record on this guy.

203
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:01,910
Don't.

204
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,090
What are you going for? I think Alex,

205
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,634
go. Is it go? No, you go. You can go

206
00:13:14,672 --> 00:13:15,260
more.

207
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,200
You can stop. Three,

208
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,520
two, one.

209
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,600
What? Does that count? As I took his pants off,

210
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:36,426
I did exactly what I wanted. And somehow Alexa

211
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,554
took the guy's pants off. And I don't even know how many points that is

212
00:13:39,592 --> 00:13:42,946
worth. Probably nine. And now it was my turn, and I

213
00:13:42,968 --> 00:13:46,418
was feeling the pressure to hit something. What angle were you shooting

214
00:13:46,434 --> 00:13:49,894
the Ballista at? Yeah, I'm not telling you.

215
00:13:49,932 --> 00:13:53,206
Work it out. You built the thing. I don't

216
00:13:53,228 --> 00:13:56,918
know what I'm aiming for. It's okay.

217
00:13:57,004 --> 00:14:00,620
Still got it. Springs. Okay.

218
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,250
Can you go furtHer?

219
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,660
Nice. Sorry.

220
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,120
Sabotaging me, Roland. Oh. What, did you lock it in?

221
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:19,086
Nice. Zero, minus one. Minus one. And two

222
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,314
of the rubbers broke, and it didn't go very far, so I was on minus

223
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,806
one. Okay, so after Rowan and I spent an hour retying

224
00:14:25,838 --> 00:14:29,730
all the rubbers, we moved the car closer and had another shot.

225
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,626
Yeah, I'll go for man. No, I go for the car door. No, I go

226
00:14:32,648 --> 00:14:33,380
for man.

227
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:40,120
Three, two, one.

228
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,630
Yay. Whoa.

229
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:48,214
Whoa. What?

230
00:14:48,412 --> 00:14:52,166
It didn't hit right on it.

231
00:14:52,188 --> 00:14:55,980
Just fluid. Yeah, that's going to destroy your windscreen if it flies off.

232
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,082
And that bolt hit sideways and bounced off. And this is all very

233
00:15:01,136 --> 00:15:04,254
hard. I'm starting to think that expos and Ballistas aren't the best

234
00:15:04,292 --> 00:15:07,738
siege weapons or I'm just horrible at making things. And unlike

235
00:15:07,754 --> 00:15:11,262
the game, where the Expo automatically locks onto enemies, we were having

236
00:15:11,316 --> 00:15:15,410
trouble hitting anything. So I moved the car a little bit closer

237
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,820
and took aim at the Spartan guy.

238
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,414
Think that's just going to bounce straight off, actually. Two,

239
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:37,720
one. Oh.

240
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,382
Whoa. Straight through.

241
00:15:41,516 --> 00:15:45,206
Finally, mate. Alex. Amazing aim.

242
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:48,618
Thank you. This is all we had from that.

243
00:15:48,704 --> 00:15:49,580
I know.

244
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:55,580
Oh, my God. Yeah. Don't touch him.

245
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,840
Did you aim for his heart?

246
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:03,994
And that was pretty impressive damage. It only stopped because the bolt

247
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:07,474
got wider and it almost went all the way through broadhead into him.

248
00:16:07,512 --> 00:16:09,540
Yeah, it'll absolutely go through that.

249
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:14,862
Poor guy. So then Hamilton's mate had a shot at the car door.

250
00:16:15,006 --> 00:16:16,580
You winded it all the way.

251
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,360
Three, two,

252
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:24,342
one. Whoo. Did you get it?

253
00:16:24,396 --> 00:16:27,698
Yeah, it went in maybe.

254
00:16:27,804 --> 00:16:30,250
Oh. Whoa. What? Holy.

255
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,090
Dude, that sliced through so easily.

256
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:39,018
Look at that. The way I just, like, peeled it up. Peeled it

257
00:16:39,024 --> 00:16:42,766
like a can. Just one. Oh, it must have hit this and

258
00:16:42,788 --> 00:16:45,520
then pushed up.

259
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:50,720
And now it's Hamilton's turn to shoot the Santa guy.

260
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,400
Drop it lower.

261
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:06,120
Holy. Oh,

262
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,640
my God. In the heart again.

263
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,960
He's got a spear sticking out.

264
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:22,474
Okay, now, we know that the bolt would do some serious damage, but we still

265
00:17:22,512 --> 00:17:26,042
don't know how easy it is to use while driving, so I tried

266
00:17:26,096 --> 00:17:29,900
that. Whenever you're ready.

267
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:34,510
Yeah. Drive slowly next to them. I won't point it at you, boys.

268
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:38,480
Thank you. Yeah. Go slowly next to them.

269
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,140
Go a bit closer to him.

270
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:58,360
And that was ridiculously hard to aim, so I tried again.

271
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:05,960
You can go back.

272
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,802
And we couldn't find the bolt in the long grass, so we formed a search

273
00:18:15,856 --> 00:18:18,986
and rescue line. And besides finding a body that Hamilton had

274
00:18:19,008 --> 00:18:21,850
buried on his farm earlier, we couldn't find the bolt.

275
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:29,150
But luckily, on the way back, Alexis stepped on it, which is great,

276
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,190
as now Hamilton won't die while mowing his lawn.

277
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:37,006
Okay. We were getting pretty bored and sunburnt, so we told ourselves that this

278
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:38,430
was the last attempt.

279
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,580
Here we go. Get him, Alex. Yes.

280
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,010
In the neck. Oh, wait, I don't need to keep driving.

281
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:19,114
And that was extremely fun to shoot and did some great damage.

282
00:19:19,162 --> 00:19:23,006
And as for which one of us wins my made up competition, probably Alexa for

283
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:26,174
taking the guy's pants off. And there you go. I think I did a pretty

284
00:19:26,212 --> 00:19:29,246
good job of replicating that expo from Clash of Clans.

285
00:19:29,358 --> 00:19:33,102
And Mayan actually had enough power to even take down armored troops

286
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:36,562
from the game. So go download Clash of clans right now

287
00:19:36,616 --> 00:19:40,242
and scan my QR code and join the event to not only plant trees,

288
00:19:40,306 --> 00:19:44,182
but also potentially win a Tesla and other prizes. And considering I'm number

289
00:19:44,236 --> 00:19:47,558
four right now, we are pretty close. Also, a hot tip for new and

290
00:19:47,564 --> 00:19:50,886
existing players. You should get the builder package for your town, and that gives you

291
00:19:50,908 --> 00:19:54,342
the advantage of progressing quickly in the early stages of the game.

292
00:19:54,396 --> 00:19:57,974
Good luck in the event. Thank you so much for watching. If you like

00:19:58,012 --> 00:20:00,300
