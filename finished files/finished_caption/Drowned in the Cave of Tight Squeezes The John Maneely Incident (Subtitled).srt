00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,290
On September 28, 2008, John Manili,

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,970
alongside his trusted friends John Valentin and Charles Reed Henry,

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,442
embarked on a daring exploration of the sorcerer Dudube's Cave,

4
00:00:10,506 --> 00:00:13,258
hoping to create lasting memories. Tragically,

5
00:00:13,354 --> 00:00:16,638
this adventure turned into a heart wrenching tale as fate had a

6
00:00:16,644 --> 00:00:20,058
somber outcome in store forever in printing Manili's

7
00:00:20,074 --> 00:00:23,280
name in the cave's history in the most devastating way.

8
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,574
Born John Manili's life

9
00:00:27,612 --> 00:00:31,266
was intense, with passions for motorcycling and scuba diving.

10
00:00:31,378 --> 00:00:34,646
His early training days were spent locally, but it wasn't long before

11
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:38,018
he joined Brighton's British subaquatic Club, or BSAC

12
00:00:38,114 --> 00:00:40,966
ranks. His presence was quickly felt.

13
00:00:41,078 --> 00:00:44,358
He became an integral and reliable member, urging his fellow

14
00:00:44,374 --> 00:00:48,454
divers toward experiences and heightened safety in their underwater endeavors.

15
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:51,606
His thirst for the unexplored was insatiable. He wasn't

16
00:00:51,638 --> 00:00:54,862
content with being a regular diver. He yearned for more.

17
00:00:54,996 --> 00:00:58,958
This led him to acquire a rebreather and embark on specialized training,

18
00:00:59,044 --> 00:01:03,214
propelling him into advanced diving groups and exploring deeper, more challenging

19
00:01:03,262 --> 00:01:06,946
wrecks. Rebreather diving recycles exhaled air,

20
00:01:07,048 --> 00:01:10,530
removing carbon dioxide and adding oxygen, allowing longer,

21
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,366
quieter dives. It's challenging due to the complex equipment

22
00:01:14,398 --> 00:01:17,310
management and the need for precise gas balance.

23
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:21,714
Inexperience can lead to life threatening situations like oxygen toxicity

24
00:01:21,762 --> 00:01:25,042
or hypoxia, making it risky for untrained divers.

25
00:01:25,186 --> 00:01:28,598
His journey eventually steered him towards the world of cave diving in

26
00:01:28,604 --> 00:01:31,746
the UK and France. Parallel to Manili's journey

27
00:01:31,778 --> 00:01:35,066
was John Valanthen, a figure synonymous with the pinnacle of

28
00:01:35,088 --> 00:01:38,138
cave exploration and rescue. Holding a world record.

29
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:41,626
Volanthan's impact on the field, especially his crucial role in

30
00:01:41,648 --> 00:01:45,626
the 2018 Tham Lewing Thai rescue has redefined cave diving

31
00:01:45,658 --> 00:01:49,214
over two decades. His fearless explorations had written new

32
00:01:49,252 --> 00:01:52,554
chapters of these newly discovered super caves. On November

33
00:01:52,602 --> 00:01:55,986
18, 2007, Philanthropan etched another landmark of

34
00:01:56,008 --> 00:01:59,758
achievement in the history of cave diving. By braving the sorcere dude,

35
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:03,534
he navigated its treacherous depths, overcoming formidable obstacles

36
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:07,982
and laying down 476ft, or 145 meters of line.

37
00:02:08,136 --> 00:02:11,766
A year later, Andre Glore and Pedro Bellardi ventured into the

38
00:02:11,788 --> 00:02:17,026
cave, flaying a second marked line, reaching a new tremendous 1549ft,

39
00:02:17,058 --> 00:02:20,318
or 472 meters from the entrance. Their efforts

40
00:02:20,354 --> 00:02:23,670
were followed by successive dives continuously pushing the boundaries,

41
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:28,134
extending the cave's known limits to an astonishing 3445ft,

42
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:31,462
or 1050 meters. Inspired by these feats,

43
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,826
John Manilia was drawn deeper into the quest to explore the

44
00:02:34,848 --> 00:02:38,686
source of Dudup. To embark on this formidable journey, he enlisted the

45
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:41,966
support of his friends and trusted divers, Charles Reed Henry and John

46
00:02:41,988 --> 00:02:45,466
Valanthan together, they prepared to confront the cave's daunting

47
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:49,074
depths, a testament to their unyielding spirit and shared bond in the face

48
00:02:49,112 --> 00:02:52,286
of the unknown. The three friends expedition into the cave's

49
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,430
depths would be fraught with danger at every turn. The narrow, shallow passages

50
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,146
presented a treacherous challenge, with the ever present risk of damaging

51
00:03:00,178 --> 00:03:03,542
crucial equipment in an environment where every inch and every

52
00:03:03,596 --> 00:03:07,334
second counted. These constricted pathways significantly impeded the

53
00:03:07,372 --> 00:03:10,302
possibility of a swift retreat in case of an emergency.

54
00:03:10,466 --> 00:03:14,646
On the eve of this fateful dive, John Maniley faced grave concerns

55
00:03:14,678 --> 00:03:18,246
from his friends and fellow divers John Blanthen and Charles Reed Henry.

56
00:03:18,358 --> 00:03:21,370
They warned him about the considerable size of his rebreather,

57
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,926
underscoring the severe impracticality and inherent danger of

58
00:03:24,948 --> 00:03:28,506
using such bulky equipment in the cave's more restrictive and perilous

59
00:03:28,538 --> 00:03:32,010
sections. Yet Manili, in a move marked by recklessness,

60
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:35,546
chose to disregard these warnings, emboldening himself to confront

61
00:03:35,578 --> 00:03:39,438
the cave's looming threats with gear ill suited for its harsh realities.

62
00:03:39,614 --> 00:03:43,358
Adding a layer of peril to this already dangerous endeavor was Maneli's

63
00:03:43,374 --> 00:03:46,866
compromised physical state. He bore the lasting scars of

64
00:03:46,888 --> 00:03:50,646
a severe back injury from a motorcycle accident in 1998,

65
00:03:50,748 --> 00:03:54,626
an injury that had not just left him with physical marks but also persistent

66
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:57,950
limitations. This critical aspect of his condition,

67
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,446
often overlooked, became a pivotal factor in the events

68
00:04:01,478 --> 00:04:05,430
that unfolded. The injuries severely curtailed his maneuverability,

69
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,782
especially in the cave's tight, unforgiving passages that demanded the utmost agility

70
00:04:09,846 --> 00:04:12,986
and flexibility as the three friends would have to delve

71
00:04:13,018 --> 00:04:16,522
deeper into the cave system. The combination of the challenging environment,

72
00:04:16,586 --> 00:04:20,286
the bulky equipment, and Manili's physical limitations created a

73
00:04:20,308 --> 00:04:23,466
scenario fraught with danger. The cave's claustrophobic

74
00:04:23,498 --> 00:04:27,070
passages became a gauntlet barely wide enough to allow passage.

75
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:30,766
Each move carried weight in the hostile underground world, and the shadow

76
00:04:30,798 --> 00:04:33,966
of potential catastrophe loomed large over the journey.

77
00:04:34,078 --> 00:04:38,138
Beneath a modest twelve x 16 foot, or three by four meter opening,

78
00:04:38,254 --> 00:04:41,570
the beginning of the cave plummets to a daunting 5 meters.

79
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,750
Divers begin their descent through a vertical crack, or known as s one,

80
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,606
leading to the ominous edge of a shaft called S three. The cave's

81
00:04:49,638 --> 00:04:52,918
complex layout includes several chimney halls dropping

82
00:04:52,934 --> 00:04:56,262
to a chilling 215ft, or 65 meters.

83
00:04:56,406 --> 00:05:00,842
A hazardous passage, widened yet treacherous, lies 541ft,

84
00:05:00,896 --> 00:05:04,142
165 meters beneath s three.

85
00:05:04,276 --> 00:05:06,906
The journey beyond is marked by poor visibility,

86
00:05:07,018 --> 00:05:10,154
dense sediment, and the challenges of navigating with scooters.

87
00:05:10,282 --> 00:05:13,754
The fissure's floor, strewn with sharp, fossil rich boulders,

88
00:05:13,802 --> 00:05:17,182
leads to a constricted passage culminating in a disturbance zone

89
00:05:17,246 --> 00:05:21,266
at 1800ft, 555 meters. That descends into

90
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:25,054
a steep, gravel filled corridor. This formidable cave stretches

91
00:05:25,102 --> 00:05:28,006
over 4576ft.

92
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:31,446
1400 meters, presenting a harrowing challenge to even the

93
00:05:31,468 --> 00:05:35,206
most skilled cave divers. The secluded sorcere dude is

94
00:05:35,228 --> 00:05:38,966
an obscure water filled cave at the foot of Montrezu, near Mutt,

95
00:05:38,998 --> 00:05:42,278
France. It's infamous as France's coldest town

96
00:05:42,374 --> 00:05:45,766
endures brutally low temperatures in winter, contrasting sharply

97
00:05:45,798 --> 00:05:49,178
with its intense summers. This extreme climate gave it

98
00:05:49,184 --> 00:05:52,406
the name Little Siberia. The cave, a hidden gem

99
00:05:52,438 --> 00:05:56,334
in the middle of this rugged landscape, sits at the level of a

100
00:05:56,372 --> 00:06:00,154
place where silence and solitude reign. Its dense, sprawling forest

101
00:06:00,202 --> 00:06:03,530
are a hallmark of the Jura region. Adding to the seclusion of the

102
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,422
surrounding area. This range also serves as a natural boundary,

103
00:06:07,486 --> 00:06:10,702
marking the national border between Switzerland and France.

104
00:06:10,846 --> 00:06:14,542
The cave, with its crystal clear waters, is a diver's enigma.

105
00:06:14,606 --> 00:06:18,546
Inviting, yet intimidating. Promising adventure, but also echoing

106
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:21,986
with the solitude of its surroundings. Delving into the cave's

107
00:06:22,018 --> 00:06:26,146
depths, divers are met with a relentless chill. As the water temperature stubbornly

108
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:29,910
hovers around 43 degrees Fahrenheit, six degrees Celsius.

109
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:34,310
This constant cold forms an unyielding barrier. The cave's waterways

110
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:38,090
carve a complex path towards the rocks, weaving an intricate web

111
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,142
that has long baffled even the most seasoned divers.

112
00:06:41,286 --> 00:06:44,890
The source of Dudupe has become a siren call for daring divers,

113
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:48,074
drawing them into the depths in the quest for discovery.

114
00:06:48,202 --> 00:06:51,098
Yet this pursuit is not without its perils.

115
00:06:51,194 --> 00:06:54,666
The cave has claimed the lives of many who have dared to go too far

116
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,202
into the cave. On September 28,

117
00:06:57,256 --> 00:07:01,086
2008, the expedition commenced with John Manili, John Valanthan,

118
00:07:01,118 --> 00:07:04,094
and Charles Reed Henry to explore the sorcere dudup.

119
00:07:04,222 --> 00:07:07,694
Embracing the practice of autonomous diving, each member ventured

120
00:07:07,742 --> 00:07:11,446
into the cave's depths independently, facing the unknown. Without the aid of

121
00:07:11,468 --> 00:07:14,934
a team. The entrance to the cave presented the first test of their

122
00:07:14,972 --> 00:07:18,994
resolve. Buried with a cumbersome rebreather, John Manili cautiously

123
00:07:19,042 --> 00:07:22,406
navigated the confined space. Every move was measured

124
00:07:22,438 --> 00:07:26,246
as the risk of entrapment in such tight quarters was a constant threat.

125
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:30,118
Approximately 13 meters into the dive, John encountered the upper ledge

126
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:33,374
of the shaft, known as S Two. Descending into S

127
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:36,874
two was like plunging into an abyss. The water turned icy

128
00:07:36,922 --> 00:07:40,138
and pitch black, forcing him to rely solely on his flashlights

129
00:07:40,154 --> 00:07:43,754
to pierce the engulfing darkness. The shaft's nearly vertical

130
00:07:43,802 --> 00:07:47,198
descent tested his skills and nerves. As he made his way deeper.

131
00:07:47,294 --> 00:07:51,390
The chilling waters in the oppressive darkness created a sense of claustrophobia.

132
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,234
The cave walls looming ominously close. Every decision John

133
00:07:55,272 --> 00:07:58,438
made carried weight, as a single misstep could lead to a

134
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:01,526
catastrophe. The cave's depths were unforgiving, and the

135
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:05,634
complexity of the environment demanded constant vigilance. The underwater

136
00:08:05,682 --> 00:08:09,234
passage was a labyrinth, with each twist and turn holding potential dangers,

137
00:08:09,282 --> 00:08:13,274
from sudden drop offs to narrow bottlenecks that could easily ensnare John.

138
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:16,538
The chilling silence of the cave was broken only by the sound of

139
00:08:16,544 --> 00:08:20,106
his breathing and the bubbles rising from his rebreather. As he

140
00:08:20,128 --> 00:08:23,654
ventured further, the cave's claustrophobic grip tightened.

141
00:08:23,782 --> 00:08:27,054
The passage narrowed, and the sediment strewn floor became more

142
00:08:27,092 --> 00:08:30,522
treacherous, with dragged rocks and boulders lurking in the shadows.

143
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:34,090
The cave's environment was a constant battle against the elements.

144
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,774
The cold water was sapping his strength, and the narrow passages demanded

145
00:08:37,822 --> 00:08:40,862
precision and the darkness challenging his senses.

146
00:08:41,006 --> 00:08:44,670
Every meter he descended took him further from the safety of the surface,

147
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,858
deeper into the heart of the cave. As he progressed, the cave's futures

148
00:08:48,894 --> 00:08:52,546
became more daunting. Stalactites and Stalagmites formed

149
00:08:52,578 --> 00:08:56,578
eerie shapes in the beam of his lights. The water's chill penetrated

150
00:08:56,594 --> 00:09:00,242
his wetsuit, reminding him of the cave's indifference to human presence.

151
00:09:00,386 --> 00:09:04,262
As John Manili descended deeper into the sorcere dude, the environment

152
00:09:04,326 --> 00:09:09,542
transformed into a more menacing and constricted labyrinth. At 1056ft,

153
00:09:09,606 --> 00:09:13,226
322 meters, the shaft's descent became steeper.

154
00:09:13,338 --> 00:09:17,386
It led him to an ominous, more giant obstruction hole, its mouth

155
00:09:17,418 --> 00:09:20,558
cluttered with chunky, blocky materials. To the right of

156
00:09:20,564 --> 00:09:23,666
the shaft floor, a narrow crevice beckoned, leading to an

157
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:27,246
uphill cave passage. This area was fraught with challenges.

158
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:31,118
A significant sediment accumulation resulted in intense turbidity,

159
00:09:31,214 --> 00:09:34,030
clouding John's vision and complicating navigation.

160
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,482
The water, thick with particulate matter, created a disorienting, murky veil,

161
00:09:38,546 --> 00:09:41,826
demanding the utmost concentration and skill to proceed.

162
00:09:41,938 --> 00:09:45,426
Despite the conditions, John's resolve remained unshaken.

163
00:09:45,538 --> 00:09:48,990
The underwater realm fueled his determination with its dark beauty

164
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,806
and profound silence. Navigating through the cave, John encountered

165
00:09:52,838 --> 00:09:55,974
a passage on the left, a gateway to a further valleyside

166
00:09:56,022 --> 00:10:00,018
corridor. The narrow and treacherous passage had been slightly expanded

167
00:10:00,054 --> 00:10:03,322
in 2002, yet remained a daunting challenge.

168
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:06,846
With seasoned expertise, John meticulously maneuvered through

169
00:10:06,868 --> 00:10:11,050
the claustrophobic route, his every movement calculated and deliberate.

170
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,718
The confined space demanded exceptional control and awareness,

171
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:18,302
as any misstep could lead to entrapment or equipment failure.

172
00:10:18,446 --> 00:10:22,206
Monitoring his depth gauge and air supply with unwavering attention,

173
00:10:22,318 --> 00:10:26,174
John advanced through the passage and commenced directly below into the shaft

174
00:10:26,222 --> 00:10:30,082
floor of S three. The once open hall had succumbed to a collapse,

175
00:10:30,146 --> 00:10:33,906
burying its initial 98ft, or 30 meters and transforming

176
00:10:33,938 --> 00:10:37,010
it into a treacherous maze of debris and tight squeezes.

177
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:41,446
After covering a daunting distance of approximately 1821ft,

178
00:10:41,478 --> 00:10:45,334
or 550 meters. He arrived at the first major fold zone,

179
00:10:45,462 --> 00:10:49,014
a geological challenge marked by steep slopes and unpredictable

180
00:10:49,062 --> 00:10:52,346
terrain. Angling sharply downward, the passage

181
00:10:52,378 --> 00:10:55,754
was lined with accumulations of gravel banks, remnants of ancient

182
00:10:55,802 --> 00:10:59,642
underwater currents. Now silent and still, the gravel banks,

183
00:10:59,706 --> 00:11:02,410
a labyrinth of natural barriers, impeded his progress,

184
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,778
forcing him to navigate cautiously. The loose gravel and

185
00:11:05,784 --> 00:11:09,054
the steep incline created a treacherous landscape where every movement

186
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:12,862
could trigger a cascade, altering the cave's delicate equilibrium.

187
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:16,722
As John delved deeper, the cave's confining walls seemed to close

188
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:20,950
around him, creating a palpable sense of claustrophobia. The limited space,

189
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:24,326
combined with the sheer depth he had reached, underscored the risks of

190
00:11:24,348 --> 00:11:28,434
his solitary endeavor. His air supply, a lifeline in this submerged

191
00:11:28,482 --> 00:11:32,598
world, was dwindling, and he was acutely aware of its preciousness.

192
00:11:32,774 --> 00:11:36,454
Adhering to the rule of thirds, a critical safety protocol and cave

193
00:11:36,502 --> 00:11:40,006
diving, John calculated his air reserves, ensuring he retained

194
00:11:40,038 --> 00:11:42,786
enough for a safe ascent. In scuba diving,

195
00:11:42,838 --> 00:11:46,266
particularly in overhead environments like caves and wrecks, the rule

196
00:11:46,298 --> 00:11:50,074
of thirds is a critical guideline for gas management. It mandates

197
00:11:50,122 --> 00:11:54,010
that divers allocate one third of their gas supply for the onward journey,

198
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:57,806
another third for the return, and reserve the final as a crucial safety

199
00:11:57,838 --> 00:12:01,266
margin. The rule is essential where direct descent is not an

200
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:04,558
option. And the divers must retrace their path to exit.

201
00:12:04,654 --> 00:12:08,146
When diving with a buddy, especially one with a higher gas consumption

202
00:12:08,178 --> 00:12:11,122
rate, the third is often based on the buddy's supply,

203
00:12:11,266 --> 00:12:14,514
necessitating an earlier turnaround or carrying extra gas

204
00:12:14,562 --> 00:12:18,406
for safety. This cautious approach ensures a safe return. From these

205
00:12:18,428 --> 00:12:21,830
treacherous underwater environments. As he prepared for return

206
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,206
to the entrance of the cave, he felt good that he made it this deep

207
00:12:25,238 --> 00:12:29,002
into the passages. But due to his air running low, he knew he needed

208
00:12:29,056 --> 00:12:32,774
to get out. Retracing his path, John faced the obstacles

209
00:12:32,822 --> 00:12:36,606
he had navigated on his descent. Each twist and turn of the cave was

210
00:12:36,628 --> 00:12:40,266
a puzzle, demanding meticulous attention and skill. The journey

211
00:12:40,298 --> 00:12:43,214
back was as much a mental challenge as a physical one.

212
00:12:43,332 --> 00:12:46,814
Each stroke took him closer to safety. But the oppressive darkness

213
00:12:46,862 --> 00:12:50,354
and the knowledge of the cave's hidden dangers weighted heavily on him.

214
00:12:50,472 --> 00:12:54,462
The return swim was a race against time and his dwindling air reserves.

215
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:58,562
Navigating through the cave's claustrophobic passages with a cumbersome rebreather

216
00:12:58,626 --> 00:13:02,706
presented a formidable challenge. The precariously positioned boulders

217
00:13:02,738 --> 00:13:06,562
could easily become dislodged. Transforming the route into a perilous trap.

218
00:13:06,626 --> 00:13:09,734
John was aware of this, but he continued to push. The end

219
00:13:09,772 --> 00:13:13,926
of the S two section posed a formidable challenge. Strewn with large boulders

220
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:17,574
that created a series of tight squeezes. Maneuvering through this section

221
00:13:17,622 --> 00:13:21,498
was a delicate balance of technique and caution. The tight confines of the

222
00:13:21,504 --> 00:13:25,246
underwater labyrinth seemed to constrict around him, leaving little room for

223
00:13:25,268 --> 00:13:28,922
maneuver. To alleviate his struggle, John made a critical decision

224
00:13:28,986 --> 00:13:32,826
that would soon escalate into a dire situation. He chose to remove

225
00:13:32,858 --> 00:13:36,862
his rebreather, a decision that, under the circumstances, seemed necessary,

226
00:13:36,926 --> 00:13:40,946
but was fraught with risk. Squeezing through the narrow gap without the bulk of

227
00:13:40,968 --> 00:13:44,766
a rebreather, he relied on an alternate air source, a bottle

228
00:13:44,798 --> 00:13:47,970
he held under his arm. This temporary solution,

229
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,266
however, brought its own set of dangers. The cave's

230
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:54,582
oppressive walls, unyielding, enclosed, pressed in on him,

231
00:13:54,716 --> 00:13:58,546
exacerbating the difficulty of his movements. His preexisting

232
00:13:58,578 --> 00:14:02,122
back injury from 1998 further complicated his situation,

233
00:14:02,256 --> 00:14:06,422
making it impossible to put on the rebreather again in such confined quarters.

234
00:14:06,566 --> 00:14:10,330
Faced with limited options and a rapidly deteriorating situation,

235
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,090
John decided he needed to move faster to head back to the surface,

236
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,898
navigating the torturous path with the air bottle tucked under his arm.

237
00:14:17,994 --> 00:14:21,386
The ascent, however, took a treacherous turn. Suddenly,

238
00:14:21,418 --> 00:14:25,534
the bottle detached from the rubber hose of his mouthpiece, leaving him in a serious

239
00:14:25,582 --> 00:14:29,026
predicament far from the cave's entrance. Stranded without an

240
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:33,122
air supply in the suffocating embrace of the underwater cave, panic set

241
00:14:33,176 --> 00:14:36,318
in. In a frantic and desperate search, John attempted

242
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:40,626
to retrieve the lost air bottle. But his efforts were in vain. The murky

243
00:14:40,658 --> 00:14:43,826
waters in the tight space hampered his movements, turning the cave

244
00:14:43,858 --> 00:14:47,746
into a disorientating, treacherous maze. As the precious seconds

245
00:14:47,778 --> 00:14:51,322
ticked away, the lack of oxygen began to take its toll on John.

246
00:14:51,456 --> 00:14:54,582
His breaths became shallow, his movements sluggish,

247
00:14:54,646 --> 00:14:58,134
and his vision blurred. The cave transformed from a challenging

248
00:14:58,182 --> 00:15:01,642
dive site into a nightmarish trap. In these harrowing moments,

249
00:15:01,786 --> 00:15:05,386
the darkness of the surroundings, the weight of the water above, and the daunting

250
00:15:05,418 --> 00:15:09,242
realization of his predicament converged, creating an overwhelming

251
00:15:09,306 --> 00:15:12,922
sense of dread. As oxygen deprivation intensified,

252
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:16,686
John's struggle reached a critical point. His consciousness began

253
00:15:16,718 --> 00:15:20,862
to slip away, succumbing to the suffocating grip of hypoxia.

254
00:15:21,006 --> 00:15:24,382
Isolated and helpless, far from the safety of the surface

255
00:15:24,446 --> 00:15:27,938
and trapped within the unyielding confines of the cave, he faced

256
00:15:27,954 --> 00:15:31,506
the stark reality of his circumstances. A diver alone

257
00:15:31,538 --> 00:15:35,074
in the depths. Confronted by the unrelenting and indiscriminate

258
00:15:35,122 --> 00:15:38,726
force of nature, a dire situation was unfolding in the depths of

259
00:15:38,748 --> 00:15:41,846
the source. Doodoo. Doob. John Manley's diving partners,

260
00:15:41,878 --> 00:15:45,606
John Valanthan and Charles, emerged from the cave, only to be confronted

261
00:15:45,638 --> 00:15:49,306
by their friend's absence. As time ticked by with no sign of

262
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:52,334
John, a feeling of impending doom enclosed them.

263
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:56,286
Concern mounted rapidly, transforming into a tangible fear for

264
00:15:56,308 --> 00:15:59,342
his well being. Recognizing the gravity of the situation,

265
00:15:59,476 --> 00:16:02,794
they urgently called for emergency services. Their minds

266
00:16:02,842 --> 00:16:05,914
racing with worry, resolved to leave no stone

267
00:16:05,962 --> 00:16:09,586
unturned, John Valanthan and Charles decided to plunge back into the

268
00:16:09,608 --> 00:16:13,282
cave's claustrophobic maw in a desperate search for John.

269
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:16,786
The cave, a silent and unyielding entity, seemed to

270
00:16:16,808 --> 00:16:20,230
echo their concern. As they reached the path they had previously taken.

271
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,654
Their worst nightmares materialized when they stumbled upon a heart

272
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:27,186
wrenching scene. John's lifeless body lay trapped

273
00:16:27,218 --> 00:16:30,666
under a ledge in the main shaft of the cave. At a depth of

274
00:16:30,688 --> 00:16:34,074
85ft, or 26 meters, John had met

275
00:16:34,112 --> 00:16:37,734
his untimely end in the oppressive confines of the underwater

276
00:16:37,782 --> 00:16:41,194
labyrinth. John Belanthan and Charles, grappling with shock

277
00:16:41,242 --> 00:16:44,926
and grief, undertook the solemn task of retrieving John's body from the

278
00:16:44,948 --> 00:16:48,286
cave's clutches. Upon reaching the surface, they were

279
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:51,482
met by firefighters who immediately commenced resuscitation

280
00:16:51,546 --> 00:16:55,134
efforts. But the harsh reality set in. It was

281
00:16:55,172 --> 00:16:58,714
too late. John had succumbed to the dangers of the cave.

282
00:16:58,842 --> 00:17:02,046
The tragic loss of John Manili at the age of 32 was

283
00:17:02,068 --> 00:17:05,170
a stark reminder of the risks inherent in cave diving.

284
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,706
His demise was not just a personal tragedy, but a somber lesson

285
00:17:08,738 --> 00:17:11,814
to the diving community. I want to say thank you for
