1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,326
And so right now, I have $2 billion paths. What's the worst case

2
00:00:03,348 --> 00:00:06,638
scenario if you do anything that damages your reputation is irreversible, because you only get

3
00:00:06,644 --> 00:00:09,760
one reputation, and you literally can't bankrupt yourself out. Fuck it.

4
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,626
One of the hardest decisions in entrepreneurship is deciding which path

5
00:00:17,658 --> 00:00:21,006
to follow, especially when you have two or multiple good paths. I'm at

6
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:24,798
a point in my career where I do have a very large decision that I

7
00:00:24,804 --> 00:00:28,674
need commit to for multiple years, and I've been spending basically every waking

8
00:00:28,722 --> 00:00:31,538
hour trying to gather more data to make the right decision. One of my favorite

9
00:00:31,554 --> 00:00:34,162
things to do when I do have big decisions is to change my environment,

10
00:00:34,306 --> 00:00:37,526
and I think it happens multiple times. My favorite place to think is actually on

11
00:00:37,548 --> 00:00:40,710
planes. I often have very few distractions when I'm on planes, and I

12
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,186
quite literally get perspective. Like, I'm flying up and I'm looking down

13
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:47,258
at the Earth. I feel like I always make really good decisions when I'm in

14
00:00:47,264 --> 00:00:50,698
the air. And it's actually something that, like, really look forward to,

15
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:53,782
you know what I've been waiting for since I've been married? Going to Chili's.

16
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:56,894
We've gone to Chili's. I had, like, a seizure. Honestly, I would

17
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:59,546
go because I don't mind. I don't care about the style of the restaurant,

18
00:00:59,578 --> 00:01:03,082
but I do not like their food. I think they have amazing chips, great salsa,

19
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:06,126
and the Fajitas are strong. I hate that you go hard on this in front

20
00:01:06,148 --> 00:01:08,206
of people, because then behind the closed doors, you're like, yeah, it's not that good.

21
00:01:08,228 --> 00:01:11,738
If there's any time, like, in the fine establishments that I go to that we've

22
00:01:11,754 --> 00:01:15,106
gone to now, like, five times, we'll go. And she'll be like, it sucks,

23
00:01:15,178 --> 00:01:18,406
right? It sucks. Say it. Say it. It's not as good as

24
00:01:18,428 --> 00:01:20,998
the finest dining in the world. Just say it. I'll be like, yes, it's not

25
00:01:21,004 --> 00:01:24,838
as good. She's like, see? And then that's it for the rest of my life.

26
00:01:25,004 --> 00:01:28,022
Your chili's chin, you get, like, a stomachache from it. And then you're like,

27
00:01:28,076 --> 00:01:31,210
who are you talking about here? Who are we talking about?

28
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,998
I think you're telling me your story. So we just landed in San

29
00:01:35,014 --> 00:01:38,570
Diego, and we are going to reels event,

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,818
which is a big publicly traded brokerage for real estate agents.

31
00:01:41,904 --> 00:01:45,542
Our really close friend, Sharon Srivatsa is the president of the company.

32
00:01:45,616 --> 00:01:47,918
He invited us out. We're probably going to have dinner with him. We're going to

33
00:01:47,924 --> 00:01:51,706
speak there tomorrow. I will be making a presentation to help real estate

34
00:01:51,738 --> 00:01:55,454
agents sell more houses. But it will not be about real estate. It'll either

35
00:01:55,492 --> 00:01:58,622
suck or be great or somewhere in between. Leila's like, I'm just,

36
00:01:58,756 --> 00:02:02,130
how do I stop doing all these routines? I'm like, I can't even start.

37
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,770
I, like, tried to smoke cigarettes to get addicted to them, and I was like,

38
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,046
it was too hard. It was just too hard to stick with it. It's like

39
00:02:07,068 --> 00:02:08,710
every morning, it's like what I forgot.

40
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,434
The hardest part about growth is that the better you get, the bigger

41
00:02:18,482 --> 00:02:21,802
you get, the bigger the opportunities are and the better they are. I think the

42
00:02:21,856 --> 00:02:26,042
easiest litmus test is to determine how big of an opportunity is

43
00:02:26,096 --> 00:02:29,818
worth your attention. So right now, ten X is kind of my litmus test.

44
00:02:29,904 --> 00:02:32,426
Like, we're at 100. It's got to be a billion or more for it to

45
00:02:32,448 --> 00:02:35,262
be something that I want to dedicate time to. And so right now, I have

46
00:02:35,316 --> 00:02:38,574
what I would consider to be $2 billion paths. They're very different.

47
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:41,854
Relatively irreversible. One has potentially more upside but more

48
00:02:41,892 --> 00:02:45,406
risk. The other one is more certain but has lower upside. There's lots of things

49
00:02:45,428 --> 00:02:48,686
that can make a decision irreversible if it's a certain percentage of your net

50
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:51,818
worth or capital. I don't like making those kinds of bets. This is a quote

51
00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:54,526
from Sean Sarvata, budy of mine. He said, never want to bet the Empire for

52
00:02:54,548 --> 00:02:57,698
a pot of gold. You bet what you have and need for something you don't

53
00:02:57,714 --> 00:03:00,486
have and don't need. It's never a good bet. Anything that damages your reputation is

54
00:03:00,508 --> 00:03:03,926
irreversible because you only get one reputation. And you literally can't bankrupt yourself out of

55
00:03:03,948 --> 00:03:07,286
a bad reputation. You can't take reputational risk where

56
00:03:07,308 --> 00:03:10,694
there's only downside. Now, if I were to say, like, I want to support this

57
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:14,394
cause, I might piss off some people, but it'll move me towards a different

58
00:03:14,432 --> 00:03:17,558
group of people. So then in that case, that's a trade off more than it's

59
00:03:17,574 --> 00:03:20,490
a risk. And so that's different than what I'm talking about here.

60
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,500
And then you just have time that you can't get back.

61
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,894
Every moment you spend always has the opportunity cost of what you could have done

62
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:30,606
with that time to get a higher return. I think the number one presentation I

63
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:34,526
have on YouTube is about that concept is the only base thing we

64
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:38,094
have is time, and we make trades for

65
00:03:38,132 --> 00:03:40,914
stuff. And so the people who are better at trading it for more stuff get

66
00:03:40,952 --> 00:03:44,338
more stuff. There was this story that Tony Robbins told that. I really liked that.

67
00:03:44,344 --> 00:03:47,886
Just kind of illustrated this image is that rich people make bets

68
00:03:47,918 --> 00:03:51,554
where they can't lose on either way. So there's this guy who knows that nickels

69
00:03:51,602 --> 00:03:54,934
nowadays are made with nickel or whatever. The material they make nickel with is

70
00:03:54,972 --> 00:03:58,834
more valuable than the cost of a nickel. This billionaire knows has taken the nickel.

71
00:03:58,882 --> 00:04:02,426
He's putting it in storage as an investment, because the day that they change or

72
00:04:02,448 --> 00:04:05,850
remove that nickel from currency, because it makes no sense, he'll melt it

73
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,354
and get 40% on his money. But there are investments that are high

74
00:04:09,392 --> 00:04:12,714
return, low risk. You want to find those bets. How's it going?

75
00:04:12,912 --> 00:04:16,102
You're good, man. What's up? I'm a Treasury founder.

76
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,734
We just find banks in the US that literally pay the highest rates on cash.

77
00:04:18,772 --> 00:04:22,366
Well, give me your card. I don't have a card. Here, take a picture of

78
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:25,086
me and message me. And then the guy who managed my LinkedIn will get it.

79
00:04:25,108 --> 00:04:27,150
There you go. Oh, we got to get a good lighting. There it is.

80
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,702
Do it right now so I can tell him. Yeah, if we can get more

81
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:34,218
return on our cash, we're in a hot zone. A hot zone of recognition.

82
00:04:34,314 --> 00:04:38,226
What's all, like, entrepreneurial people? Looks like it. Let's let this gentleman

83
00:04:38,338 --> 00:04:41,622
know. Half measures. That's right. He knows. I'll tell you that story,

84
00:04:41,676 --> 00:04:44,966
man. We're running gym launch, making a lot of money. I got asked to speak

85
00:04:44,988 --> 00:04:48,390
at this personal trainer conference, and I was like, yeah, sure, I'll talk.

86
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,286
I wasn't being asked to speak. I wasn't making content like this. It wasn't like

87
00:04:51,308 --> 00:04:54,246
a normal. I was like, sure, I'll come talk. And I was like, so what

88
00:04:54,268 --> 00:04:56,566
do you want to do? He's like, well, I figure you just give a lot

89
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:59,366
of value, and then you can present your thing or whatever. And I was like,

90
00:04:59,388 --> 00:05:02,846
okay, cool. I made this really long presentation that was just like,

91
00:05:02,868 --> 00:05:06,718
very, very good. And then at the end, I had the full presentation webinar of

92
00:05:06,804 --> 00:05:10,238
how to sell it that I used to sell it before. And I was like,

93
00:05:10,324 --> 00:05:13,214
you guys probably don't need to see all this stuff, right? Like, okay, you get

94
00:05:13,252 --> 00:05:16,078
it. It's important. You got to know how to sell,

95
00:05:16,164 --> 00:05:19,166
got to understand the systems. At the end, I was like, yeah, and here's the

96
00:05:19,188 --> 00:05:21,646
price. And I dropped it. And I was like, I just went as fast as

97
00:05:21,668 --> 00:05:24,398
I could through it, and I said it like I'm saying it right now.

98
00:05:24,404 --> 00:05:27,814
I didn't actually say it. And so then I revealed the price,

99
00:05:27,932 --> 00:05:31,510
and so I did what would have been a 90 minutes presentation pitch in like

100
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,126
15 minutes after giving 3 hours plus of value. So I was like, this should

101
00:05:35,148 --> 00:05:37,926
make sense. I gave a shitload of value, and then I'll just soft toss it,

102
00:05:37,948 --> 00:05:41,446
right? And I got so much resistance from the crowd. It was

103
00:05:41,468 --> 00:05:44,858
the biggest flop of a presentation I've ever given my entire life. I think I

104
00:05:44,864 --> 00:05:47,702
made two sales like it was nothing right now. I had done a half measure.

105
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:51,194
And so it's either sell or don't sell. Don't be in between. You either give

106
00:05:51,232 --> 00:05:54,986
value or you sell shit. Don't try and mix them. If we want to make

107
00:05:55,008 --> 00:05:58,318
commitments in anything, or you're trying to go all in on a decision, one of

108
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:01,486
the best ways to do that is to eliminate the possibility of going back on

109
00:06:01,508 --> 00:06:04,574
it. A lot of people will spend most of their lives being half in,

110
00:06:04,612 --> 00:06:07,726
half out, which to me is just not in at all. It just gives them

111
00:06:07,748 --> 00:06:10,478
an excuse to feel like they're making progress when they really aren't. There's a lot

112
00:06:10,484 --> 00:06:13,918
of books that talk about going pro, going all in, burning the boats. And I

113
00:06:13,924 --> 00:06:16,806
think they all kind of go along the same point, which is that sometimes you

114
00:06:16,828 --> 00:06:19,318
have to make a bet and be willing to be wrong, knowing that if you

115
00:06:19,324 --> 00:06:22,674
make no bet, you're guaranteed to be wrong. But, yeah, for tomorrow,

116
00:06:22,802 --> 00:06:26,198
everybody there knows more about selling houses than I do. And my proof point of

117
00:06:26,204 --> 00:06:28,358
that is that they have all sold more houses than I have. So what am

118
00:06:28,364 --> 00:06:30,738
I going to teach them about selling houses? Right? I think it would be silly

119
00:06:30,754 --> 00:06:33,766
for me to try and compete on that, because there's other speakers who've both done

120
00:06:33,788 --> 00:06:36,194
it and been there more than me. So I feel like that'd be a terrible

121
00:06:36,242 --> 00:06:39,366
position to take. What I am going to do is say, if I were

122
00:06:39,388 --> 00:06:43,370
to start here, is how I would win. But if selling houses means winning,

123
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:46,714
it'll apply. Michael,

124
00:06:46,762 --> 00:06:49,946
nice to meet you. Sorry, my hands are cold. I appreciate it. Dude,

125
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:51,280
you're killing the game, man.

126
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,686
Nice to meet you, too. Riley, right? See you guys. When I was

127
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,182
in high school, I read this book called how to Make Friends that influence people.

128
00:06:59,236 --> 00:07:01,902
And I think the second chapter or something is call people by their name,

129
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:04,270
their favorite word in the whole language. And I was like, oh, that's interesting.

130
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,286
Your favorite word, it in the entire language is your own name. So you love

131
00:07:07,308 --> 00:07:09,926
hearing that word more than any other word. Well, I should say that a lot

132
00:07:09,948 --> 00:07:12,802
of times if somebody likes that word, think about this from a leverage perspective.

133
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:15,958
If you haven't seen somebody in a year, and then you show up at

134
00:07:15,964 --> 00:07:19,430
a conference and you're like Steve, and he doesn't remember your name.

135
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,746
He loses all leverage. You're the good guy. And so

136
00:07:22,768 --> 00:07:26,474
you have so much more leverage in the conversation for remembering. Thank you for calling

137
00:07:26,672 --> 00:07:29,850
reservation center. I got to see if I can get in there with

138
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,554
a tank top and water sandals. Thank you for calling Steakhouse.

139
00:07:34,602 --> 00:07:37,806
Amy speaking. How can we help you? Amy, how are you today?

140
00:07:37,988 --> 00:07:41,662
Hello, Amy. Okay. How are you? I'm good. Quick question for you.

141
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:45,166
I have reservation at 730. What's the dress

142
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:48,798
code? We don't turn anyone away unless you're wearing the following

143
00:07:48,974 --> 00:07:52,846
board shorts, swimsuits, and tank tops.

144
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:56,206
Well, if you've never turned anyone away before, then I might just have to risk

145
00:07:56,238 --> 00:07:58,100
it because I can't go back to my hotel in time.

146
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,878
Okay. I'm going to say Amy said it was okay. Yeah, no problem.

147
00:08:03,964 --> 00:08:07,078
I'll get that sent over, Though, and let them know you should be okay.

148
00:08:07,164 --> 00:08:09,826
Thank you so much, Amy. You're a lifesaver. Thank you. Like that with the ice

149
00:08:09,858 --> 00:08:13,666
cream. So we're on our way to an ice cream shop, and it's closing.

150
00:08:13,698 --> 00:08:17,446
Like, at the time we're about to get there. Layla, she was like, we should

151
00:08:17,468 --> 00:08:21,118
call to make sure that we can get in. And I was

152
00:08:21,124 --> 00:08:24,346
like, hey, how's it going? And my wife needs ice cream

153
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:27,006
or I'm going to be in the dog house. I was like, what are the

154
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:29,886
chances, one in a million that you guys can stay up in five minutes later

155
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:31,278
so I get some ice cream. I was like, I'll be in and out.

156
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:34,400
I'll be the fastest ice cream man you've ever seen. And they were like,

157
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,598
okay, but you just can't tell anyone. I was like, I will take you to

158
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:40,080
the grave except for this content that I'm making right now.

159
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:45,206
And she let us in and we got the Sundays. I've done of

160
00:08:45,228 --> 00:08:48,038
phone sales, and I've done a lot of in person sales. And there's a lot

161
00:08:48,044 --> 00:08:51,942
of mini skills that you learn in sales that are useful in every other

162
00:08:51,996 --> 00:08:54,678
environment where you need to get people to do something that you want them to

163
00:08:54,684 --> 00:08:57,766
do. The ideal way of doing is getting them to want to do the thing

164
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:00,886
that you want them to do rather than having them feel like they are doing

165
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:04,278
you a favor. The way that you ask, the tone that you ask, the laughs

166
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:07,642
that you make, the jokes that you make, all of those micro things,

167
00:09:07,776 --> 00:09:11,766
I do those things so that the person on the other end feels

168
00:09:11,798 --> 00:09:14,970
like if they see me in person. It will be a positive experience,

169
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,346
and they want to have that reward. And so they are willing

170
00:09:18,378 --> 00:09:21,742
to push or bend the rules a little bit so that I can do whatever

171
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:24,946
it is that I'm trying to do or get in or restaurant or dessert or

172
00:09:24,968 --> 00:09:28,734
whatever it is. People do nice things when they're in nice moods.

173
00:09:28,782 --> 00:09:31,074
So it's like, get them in a good mood first, then ask for the nice

174
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:31,700
thing.

175
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:43,478
You made half the presentation last night. Yeah, I kind of have this process

176
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:47,094
that sort of works. I'll outline what I'm going to say

177
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:50,700
far in advance, and then the day before, I'll change half of it.

178
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,620
We get the VIP entrance. Okay.

179
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:03,814
And then we noticed that your presentation. 300 plus slides. Yeah,

180
00:10:03,872 --> 00:10:07,342
I finished it, like, 20 minutes ago. Yeah, it looks good. Looks good? Yeah.

181
00:10:07,396 --> 00:10:10,478
And if it doesn't, I'll survive. Okay.

182
00:10:10,564 --> 00:10:14,046
Usually I get more of my adrenaline now, and by the time I get on

183
00:10:14,068 --> 00:10:17,378
stage, it's like I'm done with it, kind of thing. It's always directly proportional to

184
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:19,986
the prep. Yeah. This will be the first time I've talked about any of this

185
00:10:20,008 --> 00:10:22,610
stuff that I'm talking about in a keynote.

186
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,126
I love this tall boy. Dude, this is great. Get a little

187
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:30,406
bit of sugar, a little bit of caffeine, a little bit of

188
00:10:30,428 --> 00:10:34,530
delicious, and a little bit of bucket.

189
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,720
How many people? 350.

190
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,070
I had 100 sides.

191
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:45,334
I have 300. Oh, my God. 300 slides. I'm looking forward to it.

192
00:10:45,372 --> 00:10:49,078
Oh, thank you. You ever done a real estate audience? No, I don't think so.

193
00:10:49,244 --> 00:10:51,614
I don't talk to real estate agents. It's going to be useless for them.

194
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:59,774
They'll be like, what a waste of an hour from

195
00:10:59,812 --> 00:11:01,050
my friend Alex.

196
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:09,474
Hormones already

197
00:11:09,512 --> 00:11:12,834
know how to win because you know how to lose, so flip it. You guys

198
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:15,698
know how to win better than I could ever tell you. You measure your success

199
00:11:15,784 --> 00:11:19,266
by whether you completed the actions that would make it unreasonable that you

200
00:11:19,288 --> 00:11:22,614
will not fail, and then you succeed by default. And everyone here has

201
00:11:22,652 --> 00:11:25,606
things that they've written down from many of the talks of things that you want

202
00:11:25,628 --> 00:11:28,806
to do or want to think about or whatever. I would encourage you to make

203
00:11:28,828 --> 00:11:31,846
that a list of things that you will do. And then when you go

204
00:11:31,868 --> 00:11:35,242
back to the same condition, your same home, your same house, your same market,

205
00:11:35,296 --> 00:11:38,666
your same whatever, you change your behavior, and then that will show that

206
00:11:38,688 --> 00:11:41,626
you learned and you took one step to becoming the person that you ultimately want

207
00:11:41,648 --> 00:11:42,380
to be.

208
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,646
This step is all top of mind in terms of making actions that

209
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:52,218
would make it unreasonable that I fail with a billion dollar decision just because that's

210
00:11:52,234 --> 00:11:55,538
actually a decision I'm making right now. I'm at a point in my career where

211
00:11:55,624 --> 00:11:58,126
I have enough what I would consider singles, doubles,

212
00:11:58,158 --> 00:12:01,666
triples, that I have decided to take a

213
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:05,086
bigger swing. I'll either win or I'll learn, same as you.

214
00:12:05,128 --> 00:12:08,006
So from the bottom of our heart, Alex, you impacted our life. Thank you,

215
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:11,574
man. We appreciate you. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Thank you.

216
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,080
All I want to do.

217
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:23,538
Dude, you can be 100 X you. Stop it. Thank you, Alex.

218
00:12:23,634 --> 00:12:26,342
You're good. Chris, very nice to meet you. Appreciate you,

219
00:12:26,396 --> 00:12:29,774
Katie. Appreciate you. Photo with you and Katie? Yeah, sure.

220
00:12:29,932 --> 00:12:33,182
Rat bro. Since you had about 50,000

221
00:12:33,236 --> 00:12:36,574
subscribers. Yeah. In fact, here to see you.

222
00:12:36,772 --> 00:12:39,914
I'm going to earn that hat. I'll go wear it someday.

223
00:12:39,962 --> 00:12:43,322
Thank God. I love seeing Mosi Nation in the wild.

224
00:12:43,386 --> 00:12:46,926
I love the hustle. I love everyone coming up and sharing their

225
00:12:46,948 --> 00:12:50,434
stories. That always makes my day. I would say, though, do it in a place

226
00:12:50,472 --> 00:12:53,698
where you won't get put in handcuffs for sneaking in.

227
00:12:53,784 --> 00:12:56,706
Come up when you see me in public if you can. I'm happy to say

228
00:12:56,728 --> 00:13:00,086
hi, take pictures, whatever. Don't go into areas where you're not supposed to go in

229
00:13:00,108 --> 00:13:03,766
order to try and hang out, because it usually just doesn't end well.

230
00:13:03,868 --> 00:13:07,222
The crowd is loving you. Very nice to meet you. Thank you so much.

231
00:13:07,356 --> 00:13:11,270
Appreciate it. So that was great. I did my keynote earlier in the day.

232
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,826
I think people liked it. They may not have. I think they

233
00:13:14,848 --> 00:13:17,814
sat through it regardless. And I think we're probably going to have the afternoon,

234
00:13:17,862 --> 00:13:21,306
probably a couple of hours. Probably walk around, and then we'll head back to Las

235
00:13:21,338 --> 00:13:23,470
Vegas. Kinisi Sitas,

236
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,960
see Asimo's content.

237
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,600
Yep. Everyone.

238
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:42,162
Back in the day when I had one on ones, there was a one

239
00:13:42,216 --> 00:13:45,554
guy who I was like, so what have you done for

240
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:48,642
personal improvement? Have you done? He's like, yeah,

241
00:13:48,776 --> 00:13:52,034
it was so crazy. I realized if I don't watch Netflix

242
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,966
as much while I'm working, I get so much more done.

243
00:13:55,148 --> 00:13:58,966
I was like, there's so many things wrong with that statement. You were telling me.

244
00:13:59,068 --> 00:14:02,262
Probably just like, just. Level one of idiocy.

245
00:14:02,406 --> 00:14:05,706
Level two of idiocy is that you mentioned that you

246
00:14:05,728 --> 00:14:09,386
were watching Netflix in general while you were working .3 Is

247
00:14:09,408 --> 00:14:12,414
that you didn't actually say you were going to stop. You just said that you

248
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:15,754
cut back on how much Netflix

249
00:14:15,802 --> 00:14:19,566
you were watching while you were working. And I was just like, there's so many

250
00:14:19,668 --> 00:14:23,390
stupidities interwoven into so few words. I was flabbergasted

251
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:27,406
so you're more productive when you don't watch Netflix movies?

252
00:14:27,518 --> 00:14:31,346
Not as much. Yeah. As much as many shows in

253
00:14:31,368 --> 00:14:34,866
a row while you're being paid at your job.

254
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:36,660
Yeah, it's been great.

255
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:47,670
That's pretty. That is pretty. Oh, damn.

256
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:53,094
So if you're at the crossroads between one decision

257
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,726
that you're trying to choose between two different paths, if it's the first go round,

258
00:14:56,838 --> 00:15:00,054
I would encourage you to take the lower risk

259
00:15:00,102 --> 00:15:04,174
path that has a higher chance of success. If it's a business, there are

260
00:15:04,212 --> 00:15:08,186
stories of just unbelievable entrepreneurs. But what you don't hear is the tens

261
00:15:08,218 --> 00:15:11,674
of thousands of entrepreneurs who make that massive bet and then lose

262
00:15:11,722 --> 00:15:15,086
everything and lose five, eight years of their lives. If you are

263
00:15:15,108 --> 00:15:18,078
going to make the big swing, and kudos to you, it's an absolutely personal decision,

264
00:15:18,174 --> 00:15:22,082
burn the boats, go all in, fully commit, eliminate alternatives. No half

265
00:15:22,136 --> 00:15:25,474
measures. Because what I can guarantee you is that if

266
00:15:25,512 --> 00:15:28,854
you are going after the big swing, the way to guarantee that

267
00:15:28,892 --> 00:15:32,406
it does not work is to go half in. So if

268
00:15:32,428 --> 00:15:35,926
you're going to win, make it unreasonable that anything that was in your

269
00:15:35,948 --> 00:15:39,206
control was not controlled for, and then only lose for things

270
00:15:39,228 --> 00:15:42,006
that were not under your control. What do you think? Top five for me,

271
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:45,578
I'd go Matrix all time. I'd be willing to put Dark Knight as number two.

272
00:15:45,664 --> 00:15:48,746
It's just like he's such a good villain. It's just like he was

273
00:15:48,768 --> 00:15:51,466
just the perfect villain. The intro scene is just like one of the all time

274
00:15:51,488 --> 00:15:54,490
best scenes ever. I really like an oldie,

275
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:57,854
but I do like Gladiator Russell Crowe. You have one

276
00:15:57,892 --> 00:16:01,354
that's not, like, action heavy. Probably my favorite comedy. Fuck.

277
00:16:01,402 --> 00:16:05,070
Not too hard. 40 old virgin Wedding Crashers. Super bad.

278
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,474
And surprise bridesmaids.

279
00:16:08,522 --> 00:16:11,770
I cried during bridesmaids. It's like I couldn't breathe. I was dying.

280
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,638
Yeah, I mean, I went because a buddy of mine at the job that I

281
00:16:14,644 --> 00:16:17,574
was at was like, let's go see it. And I was like, bye. So I

282
00:16:17,692 --> 00:16:21,506
had a couple of drinks and went to the movie theater, and I was hyperventilating

283
00:16:21,538 --> 00:16:22,530
because I couldn't fucking stop laughing.
