1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,886
The traditional retail model is shifting rapidly, and there's a

2
00:00:03,908 --> 00:00:07,774
golden opportunity for anyone, yes, anyone, to dive into

3
00:00:07,812 --> 00:00:11,422
the world of ecommerce. Young, ordinary people who have

4
00:00:11,476 --> 00:00:15,482
zero experience in the world of business, very little startup capital

5
00:00:15,546 --> 00:00:18,734
and limited free time, are taking advantage of this

6
00:00:18,772 --> 00:00:21,710
opportunity to make thousand, 10,000,

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,062
and even upwards of a hundred thousand euros every month.

8
00:00:25,156 --> 00:00:28,422
So how are they doing this? Well, they are utilizing the business

9
00:00:28,476 --> 00:00:31,846
models that I'll be breaking down and comparing in this video.

10
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:35,490
In the end, I'll even show you my stepbystep framework

11
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,302
that I've personally used to grow eight brands that collectively have done

12
00:00:39,356 --> 00:00:42,938
over €50 million in revenue over the past two and a half years.

13
00:00:43,024 --> 00:00:46,602
But before we get into it, I do want to be absolutely

14
00:00:46,736 --> 00:00:50,554
transparent with you. If you've clicked this video, it's most likely because

15
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:54,334
you've got a goal of one day running a successful online business.

16
00:00:54,452 --> 00:00:57,902
But the honest truth is that 95% of people

17
00:00:57,956 --> 00:01:01,966
who start a business, a side hustle or whatever it might be, fail within the

18
00:01:01,988 --> 00:01:05,718
first few months. And I cannot guarantee you that you will see the same results

19
00:01:05,754 --> 00:01:09,650
that I have. But what I can guarantee you, however, is by watching

20
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,442
this video and paying close attention to what I'm about to tell you,

21
00:01:13,496 --> 00:01:17,294
you will have taken the first but crucial step towards becoming

22
00:01:17,342 --> 00:01:20,230
a part of the 5% that do succeed.

23
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,338
In case you've never seen or heard of me, my name is Nicolai

24
00:01:24,354 --> 00:01:28,034
Peterson. I've been trying to make money online ever since I was 16

25
00:01:28,082 --> 00:01:31,754
years old, and it was only recently that I actually found success

26
00:01:31,872 --> 00:01:35,434
through ecommerce. Prior to that, I've personally experienced with a

27
00:01:35,472 --> 00:01:38,710
long list of different business models. I've done day trading.

28
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,002
I build a SaaS platform, a fashion brand, a printondemand

29
00:01:43,066 --> 00:01:46,042
company, and the list goes on. Therefore,

30
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:49,870
I'm speaking from my own experience when I talk about these business

31
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,834
models. So, let's get into it. When picking what business model best suits

32
00:01:53,882 --> 00:01:57,150
you, there are a few things you need to consider. First and foremost,

33
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,222
do you have any specific skills that you can leverage?

34
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:03,726
Maybe you already know how to code a website. Or perhaps

35
00:02:03,758 --> 00:02:07,286
you're naturally a sociable person who knows how to sell a

36
00:02:07,308 --> 00:02:10,902
product. If you possess any skills, you're already ahead of most

37
00:02:10,956 --> 00:02:14,258
people. Next thing to consider is the starting capital.

38
00:02:14,354 --> 00:02:18,214
How much money can you realistically invest in the business?

39
00:02:18,332 --> 00:02:21,506
You also have to be aware of how many hours you're willing to put into

40
00:02:21,548 --> 00:02:24,730
the business to make it work. Now, you can definitely become

41
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,926
incredibly wealthy with any of these business models

42
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:31,594
that I'm about to go through, but some of them are way easier to get

43
00:02:31,632 --> 00:02:35,454
large profits with than others. Lastly, when you

44
00:02:35,492 --> 00:02:38,894
finally got a business up and running, you also want to consider to what

45
00:02:38,932 --> 00:02:43,178
degree the operation is able to run without your personal interference.

46
00:02:43,274 --> 00:02:47,054
Are you able to make it into passive income? Partly passive perhaps.

47
00:02:47,102 --> 00:02:50,386
Or do you need to be there full time, nonstop? With all

48
00:02:50,408 --> 00:02:54,050
of these categories in mind, let's now look at some popular online business

49
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,626
models. A service based business model leverages your skills to either consult,

50
00:02:58,738 --> 00:03:02,502
coach or perform a specific task for your clients. It often

51
00:03:02,556 --> 00:03:06,594
takes a higher level of expertise, but luckily the startup costs

52
00:03:06,642 --> 00:03:10,246
are minimal or nonexistent as you only really are relying

53
00:03:10,278 --> 00:03:14,154
on your own skills to get started. However, that also means that the time

54
00:03:14,192 --> 00:03:18,166
you have to invest is quite substantial and the possibility

55
00:03:18,278 --> 00:03:22,250
of autonomy is virtually zero. However, because people

56
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,806
usually value high quality one on one work,

57
00:03:25,908 --> 00:03:29,406
the profit margins tend to be great in this space. Now another

58
00:03:29,508 --> 00:03:32,542
very popular recent business model is info products.

59
00:03:32,676 --> 00:03:36,114
These are things such as online courses, ebooks and

60
00:03:36,152 --> 00:03:40,034
even YouTube videos. In the case of YouTube videos, you can obviously get

61
00:03:40,072 --> 00:03:43,778
started without money or any particular skills. But usually

62
00:03:43,864 --> 00:03:47,922
info products require a high level of both skills and time

63
00:03:47,976 --> 00:03:52,242
investment. I've personally in the past year spent over €50,000

64
00:03:52,306 --> 00:03:55,414
developing the best possible info product, but that would be a

65
00:03:55,452 --> 00:03:59,046
lot of money for a beginner to put into a product. As for the

66
00:03:59,068 --> 00:04:03,034
profitability, the margins are usually very high in info products based

67
00:04:03,072 --> 00:04:06,938
business, and that's because you've got virtually no cost of the product.

68
00:04:07,024 --> 00:04:11,126
The primary catch here is that you have to spend some money on marketing.

69
00:04:11,238 --> 00:04:15,102
Now the possibility of autonomy here depends on what kind of info product

70
00:04:15,156 --> 00:04:18,282
you're selling. An ebook can become passive income.

71
00:04:18,346 --> 00:04:21,406
While that would be impossible with a YouTube channel,

72
00:04:21,508 --> 00:04:25,182
yet another business model that you might have heard of is called affiliate

73
00:04:25,246 --> 00:04:29,090
marketing. Now this is where you earn a commission by marketing another

74
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,546
company's product. There are few startup costs here in the

75
00:04:32,568 --> 00:04:35,862
form of so me ads and building a website.

76
00:04:35,996 --> 00:04:40,006
The adventurous thing about affiliate marketing is that the company

77
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:43,794
which product you are selling handles the entire fulfillment

78
00:04:43,842 --> 00:04:47,714
side of the process, which obviously lowers the barrier of entry

79
00:04:47,762 --> 00:04:51,130
in the form of skills and time needed. But the problem

80
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,986
with a lower barrier of entry is that it's usually followed by a

81
00:04:55,008 --> 00:04:58,858
lot of competition. Now when it comes to autonomy, the entire

82
00:04:58,944 --> 00:05:02,762
process can be mostly automated if you outsource your marketing.

83
00:05:02,826 --> 00:05:06,430
Another business model is obviously software, also called

84
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,542
SaaS software as a service, and that's a subscription based

85
00:05:10,596 --> 00:05:14,014
software that you can access via the Internet. And you already know

86
00:05:14,052 --> 00:05:18,834
a bunch of these. These are things like Netflix, Office 365,

87
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:22,114
Zoom perhaps, and so on. The catch here is that these

88
00:05:22,152 --> 00:05:26,090
often require a lot of time, money and expertise,

89
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,062
and are rarely suited for beginners. They do,

90
00:05:29,116 --> 00:05:32,934
however, have the highest profitability and possibility of

91
00:05:32,972 --> 00:05:36,806
autonomy. And also, if you want to sell your software business,

92
00:05:36,908 --> 00:05:40,054
this is where you'll get the highest possible price for

93
00:05:40,092 --> 00:05:43,306
your business. Lastly, we've got ecommerce, which is a bit

94
00:05:43,328 --> 00:05:46,794
of a broad categorization, but we'll get into the specifics in

95
00:05:46,832 --> 00:05:50,022
just a minute. Now, the type of e commerce that I'll be teaching you

96
00:05:50,096 --> 00:05:53,742
does require a fair bit of skill. Sourcing your product

97
00:05:53,796 --> 00:05:57,626
through a reputable supplier, negotiating beneficial shipping

98
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:01,166
arrangements, creating a conversion optimized Shopify store,

99
00:06:01,268 --> 00:06:05,086
marketing your product on Meta TikTok and etc. In a way that

100
00:06:05,108 --> 00:06:08,606
attracts customers. Thankfully for you, these are skills

101
00:06:08,638 --> 00:06:12,114
you can acquire right here on YouTube, and I'll even help

102
00:06:12,152 --> 00:06:15,538
you get started today. You do need a bit of starting capital to get

103
00:06:15,544 --> 00:06:18,870
your product off the ground, though, but nothing major here around

104
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,742
€100 should be sufficient. I personally got started with my first

105
00:06:22,796 --> 00:06:26,054
and to this day most successful ecommerce brand with

106
00:06:26,092 --> 00:06:29,798
exactly €513 on my account,

107
00:06:29,964 --> 00:06:33,526
and I launched the brand for around €60.

108
00:06:33,638 --> 00:06:37,082
Initially, you'll have to invest time to get your store

109
00:06:37,216 --> 00:06:40,838
ads and supplier relationships up and running, but most of

110
00:06:40,864 --> 00:06:44,714
these operations can be outsourced quite easily when you've got a sufficient

111
00:06:44,762 --> 00:06:48,414
cash flow. But the absolute best thing about ecommerce is

112
00:06:48,452 --> 00:06:51,914
nearly the infinite scalability and profitability.

113
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:56,002
And now look, I'm obviously slightly biased towards ecommerce. It's where

114
00:06:56,056 --> 00:06:59,650
my personal expertise lies and it's what's made me my

115
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,010
money and it's what I teach my students. But the honest

116
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,766
truth is that you have to choose a business model that fits your skill

117
00:07:06,798 --> 00:07:10,902
set. Your business should be a reflection of who you are as a person,

118
00:07:11,036 --> 00:07:14,550
so it's crucial that you choose one that fits your

119
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,006
criteria. With that said, it's now finally time to

120
00:07:18,028 --> 00:07:21,926
get into my four step ecommerce framework that I've used to grow and scale

121
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:25,430
my brands. To start with, your ecommerce brand

122
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,986
as lean as humanly possible. What I always love to

123
00:07:29,008 --> 00:07:32,830
do is to start with something called preorders, and using

124
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,590
preorders is what I've had success with with all of my

125
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,286
brands, over 20 successful Shopify stores. And I know what

126
00:07:40,308 --> 00:07:43,914
you're thinking. If it was that easy, wouldn't everyone just do it?

127
00:07:43,972 --> 00:07:47,490
The reason why this works is actually because there are so

128
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,662
many people trying to take advantage of customers by selling trendy,

129
00:07:51,726 --> 00:07:55,502
poor quality products. My whole framework, on the contrary,

130
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:59,446
is built upon providing as much value to the customers

131
00:07:59,548 --> 00:08:03,126
as possible. And that's honestly one of my largest personal

132
00:08:03,228 --> 00:08:07,206
secrets. So I won't ever teach you how to do dropshipping or

133
00:08:07,228 --> 00:08:10,282
scam customers. And this is by no means a get

134
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:14,474
rich quick scheme. I want you to build a legit, stable business that

135
00:08:14,512 --> 00:08:17,242
provides actual value to its customers.

136
00:08:17,376 --> 00:08:20,586
We simply just use the technique to validate our product and

137
00:08:20,608 --> 00:08:23,742
after one to two weeks we switch to a completely in

138
00:08:23,796 --> 00:08:27,342
house brand with a three PL and such. So the first

139
00:08:27,396 --> 00:08:31,310
step is sourcing a winning product. What I love to do here

140
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,938
is to simply look at other successful brands.

141
00:08:35,034 --> 00:08:39,058
And I actually like to call this method open your eyes, because so

142
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:43,454
many people out there are obsessed over the best products by software

143
00:08:43,502 --> 00:08:47,202
tools. But in reality, you don't need anything else than

144
00:08:47,256 --> 00:08:50,994
to open your eyes and to simply become aware of what's performing

145
00:08:51,042 --> 00:08:54,614
for other brands. Take a look at what products successful brands are

146
00:08:54,652 --> 00:08:57,858
promoting in either your country or in other markets.

147
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:01,594
Personally, I love being aware of what brands in the US or

148
00:09:01,632 --> 00:09:05,958
Australia do and then implementing that in Europe or Scandinavia.

149
00:09:06,054 --> 00:09:09,690
With that said, a winning product in my eyes has some very

150
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,214
specific criteria which yours need to be able to

151
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:16,126
uphold by. Here's the three most important ones.

152
00:09:16,228 --> 00:09:19,854
A high AOV and that's average order value. This means

153
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,810
that your product should just basically, in my opinion,

154
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:26,434
cost at least €60. The second thing is

155
00:09:26,472 --> 00:09:30,418
a high margin. Your sales price for the product should at least

156
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:33,618
be three X your purchase price for the product,

157
00:09:33,704 --> 00:09:37,538
preferably more. The third and final thing is a good market,

158
00:09:37,624 --> 00:09:41,842
and this is a market without many competitors but still with a significant

159
00:09:41,906 --> 00:09:45,350
size. I typically determine this by doing some kind of online

160
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,730
research on my product by simply Google searching it and looking for competitors.

161
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,258
And if I can't find any, then that's a good sign. It's also completely

162
00:09:53,344 --> 00:09:56,906
fine if there are competitors in the market. The most important thing is

163
00:09:56,928 --> 00:10:00,426
that you know how to beat them. Setting up your store

164
00:10:00,528 --> 00:10:04,254
this is the point where you sign up to Shopify. We've got a discount link

165
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:07,994
below and create your first store. There is a free trial

166
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:11,390
on Shopify, so this is once again completely risk free.

167
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,006
So sign up, set up your Shopify store and then you're good to

168
00:10:15,028 --> 00:10:18,306
go. If you want a step by step guide on how to set up your

169
00:10:18,328 --> 00:10:21,922
Shopify store, be sure to subscribe because I'll have a video coming

170
00:10:21,976 --> 00:10:25,330
out about that shortly. Now, once you're making your store,

171
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,234
it's crucial to make it as trustworthy as humanly

172
00:10:29,282 --> 00:10:32,886
possible. So what I strongly recommend here, if you are a beginner, is to go

173
00:10:32,908 --> 00:10:37,026
onto larger, established stores and take a look at how exactly they've

174
00:10:37,058 --> 00:10:40,902
built their store and then get inspiration from that. Don't copy,

175
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:44,842
but take inspiration, because chances are they've tested a lot

176
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:48,314
on their site to improve their conversion rate. So by using their

177
00:10:48,352 --> 00:10:51,790
learnings and the entire landing page structure, you should be working

178
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,774
in the right direction. Creating a brand we

179
00:10:55,812 --> 00:10:59,866
want to strongly brand our product once we've seen some serious proof

180
00:10:59,898 --> 00:11:03,482
of concept for the product. So initially, when you're creating your brand,

181
00:11:03,546 --> 00:11:06,882
do it as lean as possible. And what I mean by that

182
00:11:06,936 --> 00:11:10,434
is you shouldn't spend hours making a logo or coming up

183
00:11:10,472 --> 00:11:13,858
with a clever name. You can always change and improve that later.

184
00:11:13,944 --> 00:11:17,970
So for now, we just want you to focus on testing the product as soon

185
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,858
and as lean as possible. With that said, as soon as you found proof

186
00:11:21,874 --> 00:11:25,526
of concept with your product, one of the first things you should do is to

187
00:11:25,548 --> 00:11:29,142
create brand guidelines. I've got a template for you to download for free

188
00:11:29,196 --> 00:11:32,474
down below. By setting up clear brand guidelines quite

189
00:11:32,512 --> 00:11:36,422
early, it just makes your brand seems so much more professional

190
00:11:36,486 --> 00:11:39,866
compared to your typical dropshipping stores. This is something a

191
00:11:39,888 --> 00:11:43,518
lot of beginners fail to do. Once again here, if you're new,

192
00:11:43,604 --> 00:11:46,794
take inspiration from your competitors as to how they've

193
00:11:46,842 --> 00:11:50,014
positioned their brand. Take a look at the colors they've used,

194
00:11:50,052 --> 00:11:52,670
the fonts, the tone of voice and etc.

195
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,866
Marketing your product now it's time to test your product.

196
00:11:56,968 --> 00:12:00,350
I've always done so on meta through Facebook

197
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,226
and Instagram ads. A good rule of thumb that I always use is

198
00:12:04,248 --> 00:12:08,134
that you should be able to test whether your product is viable by at most

199
00:12:08,252 --> 00:12:11,926
three X the sales price of your product on ads. So if

200
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:15,590
your product is selling at €100, then you should never

201
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,062
spend more than €300. Testing your product through

202
00:12:19,116 --> 00:12:23,322
ads most times I've tested all my products for around 150

203
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:26,570
to €200, and that's because once you've spent that amount,

204
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,362
you should have sufficient data to be able to read and determine whether

205
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:34,106
or not your product is viable. The main metric we're analyzing

206
00:12:34,138 --> 00:12:37,966
here is something called ROAs, which stands for return on ad

207
00:12:37,988 --> 00:12:41,402
spend. And that's basically just how much revenue you generate

208
00:12:41,466 --> 00:12:45,566
on €1. Spend on ads. So if you spend €100 on ads

209
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,798
and you've generated €200 revenue, then that's

210
00:12:48,814 --> 00:12:52,114
a roas of two. Therefore, it's calculated by dividing your

211
00:12:52,152 --> 00:12:55,506
revenue with your ad spend. If we can achieve a roas of

212
00:12:55,528 --> 00:12:58,590
above three, then we are really onto something and I

213
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,320
would see that as a successful test of your product.

214
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:06,278
I want to make it clear that this is obviously easier said than done,

215
00:13:06,364 --> 00:13:10,010
and if you're doing this on your own, you'll likely spend a few months working

216
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,674
things out and that's completely fine. That could either be because you

217
00:13:13,712 --> 00:13:17,354
can't find the exact winning product you're perhaps struggling with

218
00:13:17,392 --> 00:13:21,142
conversion optimization on your Shopify store or your ad creatives

219
00:13:21,206 --> 00:13:25,022
are lacking. These are issues I see all the time, and often when people

220
00:13:25,076 --> 00:13:29,006
encounter them, they simply quit. But I strongly encourage you to

221
00:13:29,028 --> 00:13:32,234
keep going. Take each failed product as a lesson

222
00:13:32,282 --> 00:13:36,030
and eventually, if you try hard enough for long enough, you will

223
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,666
see results. There's no doubt about it. If you're someone who

224
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:43,218
wants to get started right away from the get go and skip all of

225
00:13:43,224 --> 00:13:46,546
the months of trial and error, I've created the solution for

226
00:13:46,568 --> 00:13:50,006
you. Scaling with E Comm is an e commerce mentorship course that

227
00:13:50,028 --> 00:13:53,510
I've created with some of the best experts in the field.

228
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:57,366
But SWE is not just another course. We are

229
00:13:57,388 --> 00:14:01,602
a completely result orientated community that help entrepreneurs

230
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:05,850
build and scale e commerce stores all the way from your first million

231
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,462
in revenue to a potential life changing exit.

232
00:14:09,526 --> 00:14:13,226
We do this with personalized counseling, including a tailored

233
00:14:13,258 --> 00:14:16,394
roadmap just for you, weekly coaching calls

234
00:14:16,442 --> 00:14:19,518

235
00:14:19,604 --> 00:14:23,502
And contrary to most other courses on the market, SW is

236
00:14:23,556 --> 00:14:27,186
built by a team with actual results in the industry. Just to

237
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:31,006
reiterate, I myself personally have done €15 million

238
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:34,322
in revenue across all my ecommerce stores in the past

239
00:14:34,376 --> 00:14:37,602
two and a half years. And on top of that, we've got experts

240
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:41,110
in the community with knowledge from over €33

241
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:45,014
million in ad spend. SWE is much more than

242
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:48,306
just a course. While we do have plus 50 step by

243
00:14:48,348 --> 00:14:51,946

success stories to keep each other motivated. If you think you're a good

00:15:14,452 --> 00:15:17,678
