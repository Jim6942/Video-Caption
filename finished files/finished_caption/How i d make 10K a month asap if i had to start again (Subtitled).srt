1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,294
Hey, guys, it's Will. And in this video,

2
00:00:03,492 --> 00:00:07,086
I'm going to share with you what I would do to make

3
00:00:07,188 --> 00:00:10,606
ten K per month ASAP if I had to

4
00:00:10,628 --> 00:00:13,502
kind of start again from scratch. Now,

5
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:18,910
what I'm going to share with you is, well, it made me multimillionaire

6
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,602
about 90% of the millionaire,

7
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:26,614
of the millionaires that I know, this is what made them a millionaire as

8
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:29,718
well. And it is

9
00:00:29,884 --> 00:00:33,126
for many people. They just kind of don't know about this yet. They don't even

10
00:00:33,148 --> 00:00:36,454
know that this exists and that they can actually do it

11
00:00:36,572 --> 00:00:40,022
and how easy and simple and fast

12
00:00:40,076 --> 00:00:43,306
it actually is. Right. And I'm going to share

13
00:00:43,328 --> 00:00:46,842
that with you. I'm going to prove that to you in this video. So keep

14
00:00:46,896 --> 00:00:50,150
watching. Right. And let me explain. Now,

15
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,454
the thing that prompted me to make this video was

16
00:00:53,492 --> 00:00:57,178
I had coffee this morning with woman

17
00:00:57,274 --> 00:00:59,840
downstairs in the cafe where I live.

18
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,534
And she is, I won't say kind of her exact age,

19
00:01:03,572 --> 00:01:07,426
but let's say she's between 40 and 50 years old, lives here

20
00:01:07,448 --> 00:01:11,346
in Dubai, and she makes roughly 14,000

21
00:01:11,448 --> 00:01:14,990
pounds per month. So I think that's about $16,000 US,

22
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,166
something like that. So let's use dollars.

23
00:01:18,268 --> 00:01:21,910
So she makes about 1516, $17,000 a month

24
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,670
teaching knitting.

25
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,454
I'll say that again, 1516,

26
00:01:28,502 --> 00:01:32,540
$17,000 a month teaching knitting online.

27
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,514
So the way that she does this is

28
00:01:37,552 --> 00:01:40,870
she has a small YouTube

29
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,302
channel and she posts two videos a week

30
00:01:44,356 --> 00:01:48,362
all about, like, I don't really know a lot about knitting, but like knitting patterns,

31
00:01:48,506 --> 00:01:51,040
where to buy the materials and stuff,

32
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,554
stuff like that. Right. And she's been doing it for about

33
00:01:55,752 --> 00:01:58,900
nine months now, 910 months.

34
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:03,042
And it's not the most money in the world, but to a lot of people,

35
00:02:03,096 --> 00:02:06,598
that's like life changing, isn't it? To most people out there

36
00:02:06,684 --> 00:02:10,310
who are making two, three month in a job that they hate,

37
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,802
imagine making 1516,

38
00:02:14,866 --> 00:02:18,018
17,000 per month consistently,

39
00:02:18,194 --> 00:02:22,458
reliably doing what you love and just helping other people.

40
00:02:22,624 --> 00:02:25,386
This is the best part about what I'm going to share with you here.

41
00:02:25,488 --> 00:02:28,250
Like, it's very high integrity,

42
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,650
it's very high respect because you're just sharing

43
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,030
your knowledge and people will pay you to learn

44
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,040
what you know that they don't yet know. Right.

45
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:43,246
So I had coffee with this woman this morning and

46
00:02:43,268 --> 00:02:47,266
she explained to me what she was doing. YouTube channel. She has a free

47
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:50,306
group as well. Let's just call it a Facebook group.

48
00:02:50,488 --> 00:02:54,674
It's on this platform called School Skol.com.

49
00:02:54,712 --> 00:02:58,066
If you don't know what that is? School is basically Facebook groups,

50
00:02:58,098 --> 00:03:02,006
but better. Okay? You can sell products in

51
00:03:02,028 --> 00:03:04,886
there, and it's just like Facebook groups, but better.

52
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:08,794
So she has a YouTube channel, she has a school group,

53
00:03:08,992 --> 00:03:13,514
and she has an online course where

54
00:03:13,552 --> 00:03:16,298
you learn everything to do with knitting, right?

55
00:03:16,384 --> 00:03:19,100
And it is nine nine five.

56
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,662
So it's like $1,000. And she's selling about

57
00:03:23,716 --> 00:03:27,760
15 of them a month. 14, 1516 of those a month.

58
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,306
1000 each. 16,000. And she's

59
00:03:31,338 --> 00:03:34,980
been doing this for almost a year now.

60
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,810
It just made me think you really can teach

61
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,890
anything, whatever people would pay to learn, which is

62
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,682
most things, because of every

63
00:03:47,736 --> 00:03:51,190
niche and every industry, there's just

64
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,934
one or two or three or 4% of people that will pay to

65
00:03:54,972 --> 00:03:58,170
learn to do it very, very well at a very high level.

66
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,780
So for every hundred people, let's take

67
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,886
stopping drinking alcohol, because one of my friends has a very successful

68
00:04:07,078 --> 00:04:11,226
company teaching how to stop drinking alcohol, and he makes multi

69
00:04:11,258 --> 00:04:15,306
six figures a year, hundreds of thousands of dollars a year teaching

70
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,040
that, just selling an online course.

71
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,038
So let's take stopping drinking alcohol. Well,

72
00:04:23,124 --> 00:04:26,578
98 out of 100 people might just want

73
00:04:26,584 --> 00:04:30,130
to try and stop on their own, or maybe not stop. Maybe they like drinking

74
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,386
each to their own. But one or two out

75
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:37,574
of every hundred people might really want to stop.

76
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:41,206
They need some help. Along comes my friend, and they pay him.

77
00:04:41,228 --> 00:04:44,200
I think he charges, I think six,

78
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:48,418
six and a half

79
00:04:48,444 --> 00:04:52,314
think it's six and a half thousand that he charges for

80
00:04:52,352 --> 00:04:56,294
his, like, stop drinking alcohol program. And multiple

81
00:04:56,342 --> 00:04:59,898
people every month invest in that training. And here's the

82
00:04:59,904 --> 00:05:03,646
thing, like, you only need at that price, you only need,

83
00:05:03,828 --> 00:05:09,614
I mean, two people a month is like $13,000.03.

84
00:05:09,652 --> 00:05:13,074
Four, five people a month. And you're up there in the multiple five

85
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:16,434
figures per month. And I

86
00:05:16,472 --> 00:05:19,874
know a lot of people. In fact, pretty much. Pretty much every

87
00:05:19,912 --> 00:05:23,300
single one of my friends does this sells information.

88
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,478
And I mean, God, the least amount of

89
00:05:27,484 --> 00:05:30,834
money that any of my friends makes is like 80,

90
00:05:30,882 --> 00:05:35,174
90,000 a month. That's like the least. I've got a couple of friends

91
00:05:35,372 --> 00:05:38,534
who make upwards of three

92
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:42,460
and a half, 4 million a month, a month

93
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,294
doing this. In fact, one of them, Cole Gordon,

94
00:05:46,342 --> 00:05:49,654
recently spoke at my mastermind. You can watch his talk here on. On the YouTube

95
00:05:49,702 --> 00:05:53,598
channel. When he did that talk, he was making 3.9 million a

96
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:56,750
month teaching people how to become sales reps.

97
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:02,014
And here's the repeating pattern, that I

98
00:06:02,052 --> 00:06:04,880
see people learn something first,

99
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,482
and then they just teach it to other people. So I've got friends that sell

100
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:11,694
everything from like how to stop drinking alcohol,

101
00:06:11,822 --> 00:06:15,106
how to get a six pack, how to buy and sell items on

102
00:06:15,128 --> 00:06:18,926
Amazon, how to become a barber. I've got a friend that sells

103
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,798
how to become a barber. He's doing over one hundred K a month. I think

104
00:06:21,804 --> 00:06:25,574
he's doing more like almost 200 a month actually teaching people

105
00:06:25,612 --> 00:06:29,434
to become barbers and cut men's hair. I've got friends that sell

106
00:06:29,552 --> 00:06:33,126
trading education, and that's what made me a multimillionaire.

107
00:06:33,158 --> 00:06:36,634
I learned to trade, then I taught people to trade, and that

108
00:06:36,672 --> 00:06:40,746
made me almost $20 million. So trading how

109
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:44,586
to invest in real estate is a big one as well. How to source

110
00:06:44,618 --> 00:06:47,806
deals and sell them to investors, how to actually invest in

111
00:06:47,828 --> 00:06:51,278
your own properties. I've got a friend

112
00:06:51,364 --> 00:06:55,150
that sells how to make ebooks and put them on audible.

113
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:58,119
And you don't even want to know what he's making. If I told you,

114
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:01,778
you wouldn't believe me. You would not believe it's multiple millions a month

115
00:07:01,944 --> 00:07:05,346
that he's making. I've got friends that teach how

116
00:07:05,368 --> 00:07:09,170
to get commercial cleaning contracts,

117
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:13,366
hire someone to do the work for them, and they stay at home and just

118
00:07:13,388 --> 00:07:16,598
make a little bit of the profit. So they might get a job for 1000,

119
00:07:16,764 --> 00:07:20,780
get someone to do it for 600, stay at home and keep the 400.

120
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:26,166
I've got friends that have how to buy and sell luxury watches

121
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:29,834
online course, how to start an agency again,

122
00:07:29,872 --> 00:07:33,646
Cole Gordon, how to become a sales rep. Like any

123
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:37,440
knowledge that you have, you can sell.

124
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,886
And even if you don't yet have knOwledge, you can learn knowledge and

125
00:07:41,908 --> 00:07:46,226
then sell that as well. And this is like the fastest, easiest way

126
00:07:46,408 --> 00:07:49,698
to make minimum, minimum, ten K a month.

127
00:07:49,784 --> 00:07:51,940
Minimum. Like ten K.

128
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:58,630
It's tiny. In this industry,

129
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,054
ten K is not even the hygiene standard. And again,

130
00:08:04,252 --> 00:08:08,102
the recurring theme is usually that the people I know that

131
00:08:08,156 --> 00:08:11,738
do this, eight times out of ten, they have a skill that

132
00:08:11,744 --> 00:08:15,306
they've done, then they teach it. So I just

133
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,602
started working with a guy recently who teaches people

134
00:08:18,656 --> 00:08:22,330
how to play piano for $3,000

135
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,566
for his online course and coaching program. And you have access to

136
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:29,360
that for three months, one call a week with him, and he's doing

137
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:33,950
really well, over 100,000 a month teaching people to

138
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,118
play piano. And again, here's the thing.

139
00:08:37,204 --> 00:08:40,450
For every hundred people that want to learn piano, 95,

140
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,518
six, seven might not have a budget.

141
00:08:43,614 --> 00:08:46,962
They want to learn themselves through books, through YouTube, and that's okay.

142
00:08:47,096 --> 00:08:50,374
That's okay. And then there's just the one or

143
00:08:50,412 --> 00:08:53,766
two or three that think to themselves, you know what? I want to work with

144
00:08:53,788 --> 00:08:57,462
a professional. I know how important it is to invest in

145
00:08:57,516 --> 00:09:01,238
yourself and in knowledge to learn what you want to learn. I want

146
00:09:01,244 --> 00:09:04,346
to shortcut the learning curve, and I just want to learn to play

147
00:09:04,368 --> 00:09:06,650
piano at a very high level ASAP.

148
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,622
Those are the people that will pay the $3,000 that he charges and

149
00:09:12,756 --> 00:09:16,494
three clients a month. Three, six, nine. You're pretty much

150
00:09:16,532 --> 00:09:18,880
touching on ten K. It is so easy.

151
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,022
Selling knowledge is the fastest, easiest way to

152
00:09:23,076 --> 00:09:25,860
make money on the Internet that I know of.

153
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,966
Truly, I've done it myself. The vast

154
00:09:29,998 --> 00:09:33,906
majority of my friends have done it as well. Again, like nine out of

155
00:09:33,928 --> 00:09:37,926
ten millionaires, multimillionaires that I know sell their,

156
00:09:37,948 --> 00:09:40,774
their knowledge to get there. And here's the thing as well. It's a very high

157
00:09:40,812 --> 00:09:44,950
margin. Like, the profit can be as high as

158
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,286
95%. So there's a lot of great businesses

159
00:09:49,318 --> 00:09:52,474
out there doing a lot of money, but their margins are 5%,

160
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,978
15%, 25% selling information.

161
00:09:56,064 --> 00:09:59,820
The margin is 80%, 90% as standard.

162
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,190
This is why people get rich kind of so fast.

163
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,062
And coming back to you, the person watching this video, you can either

164
00:10:08,116 --> 00:10:12,080
teach a skill or a talent that you have right now,

165
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:16,734
whatever that is. Maybe it's football, maybe it's barbering, maybe it's fitness,

166
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:20,238
maybe it's music, maybe it's trading, maybe it's

167
00:10:20,334 --> 00:10:24,450
starting a brand, a clothing brand, or an agency.

168
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,070
If you build an info business correctly,

169
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,326
you price your product correctly, you sell the product correctly, on and

170
00:10:32,348 --> 00:10:33,160
on and on.

171
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:39,260
Right now, the money is waiting to be picked up

172
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:43,386
and put in your pocket and put in your bank. You just have

173
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:46,266
to learn how to do it,

174
00:10:46,368 --> 00:10:50,122
and it's really not that hard. And even

175
00:10:50,176 --> 00:10:53,374
if you don't have a skill right now, you can just learn

176
00:10:53,412 --> 00:10:57,582
one. So let me give you an example that one of my mentors once

177
00:10:57,636 --> 00:10:59,760
shared with me. So he said,

178
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,726
let's use golf as an example. Now, I've never played

179
00:11:03,758 --> 00:11:07,410
golf in my life. So on a scale of one to 100

180
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,420
is me, Tiger woods is ten.

181
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:14,226
Right? Now, if I want to learn to

182
00:11:14,248 --> 00:11:17,714
play golf and I want to learn properly and get their

183
00:11:17,752 --> 00:11:20,854
ASAP, I'm going to have to hire a coach. I'm going to have to pay

184
00:11:20,892 --> 00:11:23,560
someone for their information and training.

185
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:28,006
Now, I don't need a ten out of ten. I don't need a seven out

186
00:11:28,028 --> 00:11:30,874
of ten. I probably don't even need a five out of ten. I just need

187
00:11:30,912 --> 00:11:35,078
someone who's a few steps ahead of me, someone that's like three on the knowledge,

188
00:11:35,254 --> 00:11:38,346
knowledge scale. So if

189
00:11:38,368 --> 00:11:41,098
you want to teach golf, all you need to be is a three. You don't

190
00:11:41,104 --> 00:11:42,958
need to be a ten, you don't need to be a seven, you don't need

191
00:11:42,964 --> 00:11:46,222
to be a five, you just need to be three,

192
00:11:46,276 --> 00:11:49,470
four, because I ain't going to have a clue what I'm doing.

193
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,894
I'm a zero, remember? So I just need

194
00:11:52,932 --> 00:11:57,278
a two, three, four to teach me in some format,

195
00:11:57,374 --> 00:12:00,386
right? So if you're watching this right now and you're thinking,

196
00:12:00,488 --> 00:12:03,582
oh, I don't have any valuable skills or talents,

197
00:12:03,726 --> 00:12:06,934
number one, you probably do, you just haven't thought

198
00:12:06,972 --> 00:12:10,498
about it properly yet. And if you truly don't

199
00:12:10,674 --> 00:12:13,974
just learn something, it's not hard to

200
00:12:14,012 --> 00:12:17,350
learn piano.

201
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,514
One, two months of books, of YouTube, of this thing,

202
00:12:21,552 --> 00:12:24,794
of that thing of practice and you're going to start to get good

203
00:12:24,832 --> 00:12:28,330
with enough time. Same for me. I mean

204
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,978
I learned myself to trade financial markets and then after a

205
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:35,550
certain period of time one of my friends actually asked me for help

206
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,878
and then he offered to pay me for my help. And I was not a

207
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:42,154
millionaire trader, I was just doing relatively

208
00:12:42,202 --> 00:12:45,966
well. I was probably like a three or a four

209
00:12:46,148 --> 00:12:50,178
on the knowledge scale and he was a one and he wanted to get up

210
00:12:50,184 --> 00:12:53,378
to a four so he paid me and I helped him get up to a

211
00:12:53,384 --> 00:12:55,060
four. That's it.

212
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:59,074
So you don't have to be an expert.

213
00:12:59,122 --> 00:13:02,374
You can be a three that teaches zeros, you can

214
00:13:02,412 --> 00:13:06,502
be a five that teaches threes, you can be a seven

215
00:13:06,636 --> 00:13:09,638
that teaches fives, you can be a nine that teaches sevens,

216
00:13:09,814 --> 00:13:14,406
that kind of thing. So it's

217
00:13:14,438 --> 00:13:17,418
not hard to do this and if you just want to make ten K a

218
00:13:17,424 --> 00:13:20,986
month, I mean that's not hard. I've worked

219
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:24,478
with people in the past. In fact, the commercial cleaning guide that I

220
00:13:24,484 --> 00:13:28,366
mentioned earlier, he came to me and said, look, here's what

221
00:13:28,388 --> 00:13:32,270
I'm doing, can I teach this to other people? And within

222
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,282
about 810,

223
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:39,086
twelve weeks, he was already at like 30,000 pounds

224
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:42,546
a month teaching that,

225
00:13:42,728 --> 00:13:45,206
the highest month that he's ever had. I think it was a couple of months

226
00:13:45,228 --> 00:13:47,800
ago he did about fifty K. Fifty five K.

227
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:52,518
So I mean, imagine earning 55,000

228
00:13:52,604 --> 00:13:56,710
pounds from home just teaching people

229
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,766
what you're good at, what you know how to do.

230
00:13:59,948 --> 00:14:03,826
Like what impact would that have on your life, on your family's

231
00:14:03,858 --> 00:14:06,346
life? You could buy the car that you want, you could buy the watch that

232
00:14:06,368 --> 00:14:09,658
you want, you can go on a holiday that you want, you can even travel

233
00:14:09,744 --> 00:14:12,986
whilst doing this because it's like location independent. That's why

234
00:14:13,008 --> 00:14:16,318
I moved to Dubai, because one of my dreams was to

235
00:14:16,324 --> 00:14:19,738
live in a hot, sunny country. I was like, I can do that. So that's

236
00:14:19,754 --> 00:14:22,622
what brought me over here. Tax, of course, is 0%.

237
00:14:22,676 --> 00:14:25,766
Tax is very helpful. I'm not going to lie. That was part of the decision.

238
00:14:25,818 --> 00:14:28,866
But it was those two things. Number one, the weather. Number two,

239
00:14:28,888 --> 00:14:32,306
the tax and selling information. You can do it

240
00:14:32,328 --> 00:14:35,710
from anywhere. You can do it from England, from America,

241
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,900
from Thailand, from Australia, wherever you.

242
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:43,446
So it can be

243
00:14:43,468 --> 00:14:46,966
done. And I dare say that I'm one of the best in

244
00:14:46,988 --> 00:14:50,186
the world at doing this now. I mean, I've made almost $20 million doing this.

245
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:53,578
I've won awards for making all the

246
00:14:53,584 --> 00:14:56,666
money that I've made. I've worked with some of

247
00:14:56,688 --> 00:15:00,746
the best kind of people on earth that do this. Like Sam

248
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:04,762
Ovens, Alex Becker, Cole Gordon, Alan Sultanik,

249
00:15:04,826 --> 00:15:08,414
Dan Bradbury. And I've been in this

250
00:15:08,452 --> 00:15:11,200
world for almost a decade now.

251
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:15,394
And this is how I've made my money. If you

252
00:15:15,432 --> 00:15:18,660
look at me here in Dubai, living in the building that I live in,

253
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:22,100
living the life that I live, it all came from selling information.

254
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:26,260
And it is not hard.

255
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:30,590
It's not hard to do. So let me explain kind

256
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,766
of how to do it. So I've told, you know, you can

257
00:15:33,788 --> 00:15:37,046
either teach a skill that you have or learn a skill and then teach that.

258
00:15:37,068 --> 00:15:41,126
I've told you about the different kinds of skills that can be taught. Making ebooks

259
00:15:41,158 --> 00:15:44,970
and selling them on Amazon, teaching people to become sales reps,

260
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:48,460
teaching people to trade, all of that stuff.

261
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:53,054
So stage number one is skill. Stage number two

262
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:57,070
is getting attention and showing people that

263
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,382
you have the skill and

264
00:16:00,436 --> 00:16:03,946
from there, kind of building, well, not even building an audience.

265
00:16:03,978 --> 00:16:06,786
I mean, there's two ways to do this. Number one is you can build an

266
00:16:06,808 --> 00:16:10,306
audience on Instagram, on YouTube, on Twitter, whatever you

267
00:16:10,328 --> 00:16:13,810
like, or you don't even have to do that. You can just run

268
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,526
paid ads if you have the budget. You do not need a website,

269
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,600
you do not need a brand or a reputation or a personal,

270
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,854
big, shiny Instagram, you do not need it. I've got

271
00:16:24,892 --> 00:16:28,566
friends that do not have a personal brand. No one

272
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:32,378
knows who they are. They've just got ads into a sales process,

273
00:16:32,464 --> 00:16:36,026
into a sales call. They get on a call, they explain how they can

274
00:16:36,048 --> 00:16:39,386
help, and blah, blah, blah, and clients come

275
00:16:39,408 --> 00:16:43,162
on board. So if you think that you need a personal brand, you categorically

276
00:16:43,226 --> 00:16:46,378
do not. You categorically do not. If you've

277
00:16:46,394 --> 00:16:49,678
got a brand, helpful, if you have an audience. Oh,

278
00:16:49,684 --> 00:16:53,438
my God. I mean, if you've got four, five, six, 7000 followers on

279
00:16:53,444 --> 00:16:57,122
Instagram or more, you should be making tens of thousands a month.

280
00:16:57,176 --> 00:17:01,086
If you've got a YouTube following of above 510 thousand subscribers,

281
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:04,814
you should be making multiple tens of thousands a month. Same for TikTok,

282
00:17:04,862 --> 00:17:08,470
same for Twitter. It's so easy to monetize an audience and

283
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,034
sell them information, or you can run paid ads

284
00:17:12,082 --> 00:17:15,480
and all that you do is you just ask people if they need help.

285
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:19,782
That's it. And this is the part that I love about doing this, because again,

286
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:23,930
it's very high integrity, high respect, and it's very valuable.

287
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:27,338
By sharing information, you're adding a lot of value to the world.

288
00:17:27,424 --> 00:17:30,666
You're helping people that want the help and can't find the help and you come

289
00:17:30,688 --> 00:17:32,780
in and give them the help. Right?

290
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,046
So that's part of the reason why I love it, because you can have a

291
00:17:36,068 --> 00:17:39,438
big impact on people's lives. Some of the clients that

292
00:17:39,444 --> 00:17:42,654
I've helped in the past, I mean, I've made three or four or five people.

293
00:17:42,692 --> 00:17:46,562
I've actually made them over a million dollars through working

294
00:17:46,616 --> 00:17:50,318
with them. And some of their testimonials

295
00:17:50,334 --> 00:17:53,650
are here on the YouTube channel as well. If you haven't seen the testimonials,

296
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,702
please go and watch them. And don't trust me, ignore me, go and listen

297
00:17:57,756 --> 00:18:01,206
to the people who will tell you how much money that

298
00:18:01,228 --> 00:18:05,350
they've made by

299
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:09,446
doing this. So again, the steps are decide

300
00:18:09,478 --> 00:18:12,250
on a skill, generate attention,

301
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:15,338
ask people for help, speak to them,

302
00:18:15,424 --> 00:18:18,602
and if they want to learn from you, they buy

303
00:18:18,656 --> 00:18:20,926
and they give you money. And if they don't want to learn from you,

304
00:18:20,948 --> 00:18:24,634
that's okay. Those are the steps,

305
00:18:24,762 --> 00:18:27,230
right? Skill, attention.

306
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,960
Ask if they need help. If they need help,

307
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:35,906
then they exchange their money for your value, and you

308
00:18:35,928 --> 00:18:38,580
very quickly make money. And again, ten K is so easy.

309
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:45,746
The price is, you should be charging at least. I mean,

310
00:18:45,768 --> 00:18:49,334
the lowest price that I know of personally is the

311
00:18:49,372 --> 00:18:52,854
lady that I had coffee with this morning who's only charging nine nine five.

312
00:18:52,892 --> 00:18:56,774
I actually said, that's way too low. But she's comfortable there. She's happy

313
00:18:56,812 --> 00:19:00,266
with the 1516, 17,000 a month that

314
00:19:00,288 --> 00:19:03,260
she's making. She likes to live a calm life,

315
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:07,638
do her thing. She loves very, very, she's very passionate about knitting,

316
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:11,180
loves teaching people, people love learning. So it's just awesome.

317
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:15,374
What a great way to live. You do what you love, you make really

318
00:19:15,412 --> 00:19:18,526
good money doing it, and you help people and add value and

319
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:22,080
impact the world. If that's not the best thing ever, I don't know what is.

320
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,914
And that's what I do now as well.

321
00:19:26,952 --> 00:19:30,690
So the main thing that I'm doing at the moment is

322
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,354
just helping other people to do this. So people that are

323
00:19:34,392 --> 00:19:38,066
already selling information but they're not making as much as they should

324
00:19:38,088 --> 00:19:41,702
be, I help them get it right, scale up,

325
00:19:41,836 --> 00:19:45,094
implement systems and operations and whatever needs to be done

326
00:19:45,212 --> 00:19:48,054
to get them up to month, one hundred K a month, quarter of a million

327
00:19:48,092 --> 00:19:51,786
a month and beyond, like I've done myself. So the people I work with right

328
00:19:51,808 --> 00:19:55,642
now are either doing this already and they want to scale or every

329
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:59,178
now and again I help beginners as well. So if

330
00:19:59,184 --> 00:20:02,554
you have a great idea for a program for a course,

331
00:20:02,752 --> 00:20:05,990
then you can book in a call with me at the link in the description.

332
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,254
By the way, we can jump on a call, we can chat about this some

333
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:11,438
more and I'll give you some feedback, some guidance. And then if you want

334
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:15,086
my help, I can coach you one to one and help you scale up

335
00:20:15,108 --> 00:20:18,318
and get this thing working, or I can just kind

336
00:20:18,324 --> 00:20:21,570
of add some value for you, answer some questions, and at the very least,

337
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,386
even if we don't work together, you've kind of got a free coaching call out

338
00:20:24,408 --> 00:20:27,538
of it anyway. So yeah, for any of you that

339
00:20:27,544 --> 00:20:30,694
are doing this already and you want to scale, or if you're not doing this

340
00:20:30,732 --> 00:20:33,622
yet and you would like to book in a call with me at the link

341
00:20:33,676 --> 00:20:34,870
in the description,

342
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,970
and the last thing that I will say is this, if a

343
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,182
woman, I'm not kind of discrediting this lady,

344
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:49,546
but she's going to kill me

345
00:20:49,568 --> 00:20:53,114
for saying this, but if a random woman that's

346
00:20:53,162 --> 00:20:57,326
like in her kind

347
00:20:57,348 --> 00:20:59,994
of late 40s can make 1516,

348
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:03,470
17,000 a month from home teaching, knitting,

349
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:09,134
then you can probably make five or ten K per

350
00:21:09,172 --> 00:21:11,922
month. And if you're very good at what you do, then you should be making

351
00:21:11,976 --> 00:21:14,482
one hundred K a month, a quarter of a million a month, half a million

352
00:21:14,536 --> 00:21:18,194
a month and beyond. And I'm a big believer

353
00:21:18,242 --> 00:21:21,766
in karma. And I think if you truly help people and

354
00:21:21,788 --> 00:21:24,790
add value in the world, you get rewarded.

355
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,806
And you get rewarded in a big way by

356
00:21:28,828 --> 00:21:32,922
making a lot of money. You can do great things in your own life

357
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:36,874
as well. Buy yourself a car, buy yourself a big

358
00:21:36,912 --> 00:21:41,040
house, go on a holiday, fly first class, that kind of thing.

359
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:46,846
So everybody should have the ability to do

360
00:21:46,868 --> 00:21:50,526
that. But anyway, so I really hope that helps. Guys, if you have any questions,

361
00:21:50,628 --> 00:21:54,206
thoughts, comments, put them in the comments section below the video,

362
00:21:54,308 --> 00:21:57,474
I'll come straight back to you and lend a hand. I made this

363
00:21:57,512 --> 00:22:01,378
video just to help you guys inspire. You guys add some value.

364
00:22:01,464 --> 00:22:05,426
And hopefully, if just one of you goes on to do

365
00:22:05,448 --> 00:22:09,230
this and make 1020 30 40 month, then I'll have

366
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,438
done my job. And again, if you need any help with that book in a

367
00:22:12,444 --> 00:22:17,014
call with me, I'll jump on and lend a hand and make

368
00:22:17,052 --> 00:22:20,310
the money that you deserve to make. Because life is too short to be broke.

369
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:24,146
Life is too short to not achieve your goals

370
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:27,750
and your dreams. So cheesy, but true.

371
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,382
I'll wrap it up here guys, and I'll see you in the next next video

372
00:22:30,436 --> 00:22:31,134
soon.
