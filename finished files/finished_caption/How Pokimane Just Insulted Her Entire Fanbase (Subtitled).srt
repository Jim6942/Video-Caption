1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,994
It's about that time of the month again where a multimillionaire influencer decides

2
00:00:04,042 --> 00:00:07,694
that they're gonna go fully mask off and prove to everybody just how

3
00:00:07,732 --> 00:00:10,494
out of touch they are. Out of touch with what, you ask.

4
00:00:10,612 --> 00:00:14,218
Reality completely living in another dimension of privilege,

5
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:17,850
entirely forgetting that the only reason they exist in such privilege

6
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,854
is built from standing on the shoulders of the people they now laugh at.

7
00:00:21,972 --> 00:00:25,734
Yes, I'm now going to talk about Pokemon. When people

8
00:00:25,932 --> 00:00:28,790
are like, oh my God, $28 for cookies.

9
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,574
It's four bags. That's seven.

10
00:00:33,692 --> 00:00:37,480
$7 a bag. I know, I know, math is hard

11
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,326
when you're an idiot, but if

12
00:00:42,348 --> 00:00:45,878
you're a broke boy, just say so. Anyways, for those of you that don't

13
00:00:45,894 --> 00:00:49,366
know what you've just seen, let me fill you in. Pokemon is a popular streamer

14
00:00:49,398 --> 00:00:53,206
on Twitch, one of the most popular. In fact, she's got tens of millions

15
00:00:53,238 --> 00:00:57,018
of followers across all social media platforms, tens of millions of dollars in assets,

16
00:00:57,114 --> 00:01:01,262
and like most other live streamers, has done her fair share of oopsies while

17
00:01:01,316 --> 00:01:05,342
Live, which has resulted in some absolutely classic YouTube apology

18
00:01:05,406 --> 00:01:09,298
videos. Hi everyone. I hope you're doing well. This video

19
00:01:09,384 --> 00:01:12,594
is to address recent comments and criticisms that

20
00:01:12,632 --> 00:01:15,586
I've received, so I'm going to try and speed run the info of what the

21
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:19,758
big controversy is and not go into too many details. A lot of videos covering

22
00:01:19,774 --> 00:01:23,446
this are probably going to go into the many controversies of Pokimane, what she said,

23
00:01:23,548 --> 00:01:27,078
what she's done over the years, but that's done to death. So instead, I want

24
00:01:27,084 --> 00:01:30,406
to look at how ridiculous this entire situation's been and how

25
00:01:30,428 --> 00:01:34,726
this drama has basically been created out of nothing at all apart from ego.

26
00:01:34,838 --> 00:01:38,614
First off, timeline of events. What started it all was the most mundane,

27
00:01:38,662 --> 00:01:41,786
boring shit you can imagine. Pokemon released some cookies.

28
00:01:41,898 --> 00:01:45,210
Seriously, that's what this is all about. Her snack brand,

29
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:49,274
Minor, was released along with the first product called Midnight

30
00:01:49,322 --> 00:01:53,450
Cookies. These cookies were heavily criticized for two reasons.

31
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,082
First, the price. Each pack of 4oz cost

32
00:01:57,156 --> 00:02:00,226
$7, with the only way to buy a pack being a

33
00:02:00,248 --> 00:02:03,822
four pack for $28 plus. Then of course, shipping and handling

34
00:02:03,886 --> 00:02:07,310
fees. Basically, $28 for 16oz of

35
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,534
cookies. Expensive? Yeah, definitely. Then the other

36
00:02:10,572 --> 00:02:14,006
reason for the criticism that ties directly into the pricing is

37
00:02:14,028 --> 00:02:18,258
that these cookies were very quickly discovered to be a slightly different version

38
00:02:18,354 --> 00:02:22,246
of an existing snack that is sold in Costco called Totes

39
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:26,026
Midnight cookies. Now, these were already criticized by some people for

40
00:02:26,048 --> 00:02:29,274
being expensive, although nice, and they were $10 for

41
00:02:29,312 --> 00:02:32,938
14oz. So for like a third of the price, you get almost the

42
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,994
same amount. So there you go. That's the whole drama,

43
00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:39,246
at least the initial part of it, that shouldn't have really been a big

44
00:02:39,268 --> 00:02:42,414
deal in the first place. Basically, people were accusing her

45
00:02:42,452 --> 00:02:45,310
of ripping off the brand. Now, obviously,

46
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,514
multimillionaire didn't rip off a well known cookie brand. She just worked

47
00:02:48,552 --> 00:02:51,826
with the creators of those cookies creation foods to

48
00:02:51,848 --> 00:02:55,506
make her own version with a slight change up in formula and with her own

49
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:59,138
packaging. This is commonly referred to as white labeling, and sorry to be

50
00:02:59,144 --> 00:03:01,830
the bearer of bad news, but this is how a lot of things are made,

51
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,414
especially influencer products. So basically, this drama is

52
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:08,882
that the cookies are similar to all the cookies and more expensive.

53
00:03:09,026 --> 00:03:12,266
If this entire story ends there, obviously I'm not going to talk about it and

54
00:03:12,288 --> 00:03:15,962
I'd basically be sleeping, because realistically, no one should care about

55
00:03:16,016 --> 00:03:19,802
any of this. Influencer products are always going to be more expensive because

56
00:03:19,856 --> 00:03:23,706
you're buying something almost exclusively for the name brand behind it to

57
00:03:23,728 --> 00:03:27,150
support them, at least to begin with. Later on, maybe the product

58
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,606
stands on its own and takes a life of its own away from

59
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:34,202
that brand name, but at the very beginning, you're basically paying a premium

60
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:37,698
because it's from the creator that you watch. Otherwise, why would you buy them in

61
00:03:37,704 --> 00:03:40,994
the first place? You can probably get good cookies at a local place.

62
00:03:41,112 --> 00:03:44,610
Why would you need to get these? So them being expensive is

63
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,974
not that much of a drama, in my opinion, other than to say, oh,

64
00:03:48,012 --> 00:03:51,446
greedy influencer millionaire wants to earn more money for

65
00:03:51,468 --> 00:03:55,106
their greedy influencer millionaire lifestyle, which waters

66
00:03:55,138 --> 00:03:58,534
wet, I guess. So this was kind of confusing to me to see everyone going

67
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,834
too crazy about it, because this is just another thing that they do.

68
00:04:01,952 --> 00:04:05,482
Obviously, nobody's ever seen an influencer version of a product having

69
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:09,226
unique value or being a lower cost of a generic brand. That's just

70
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:12,314
not real life. So as a content creator myself, when I saw

71
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,806
this going on, I thought, Pokemon's been around on the Internet for

72
00:04:15,828 --> 00:04:18,958
such a long time, doing this job for such a long time, she's just going

73
00:04:18,964 --> 00:04:22,718
to ignore people talking about the price, clarify on the fact it's not a

74
00:04:22,724 --> 00:04:26,538
ripoff, and move on with life, continue to just earn her dragon's

75
00:04:26,554 --> 00:04:29,666
horde of wealth like she's been doing for the last five or so years.

76
00:04:29,848 --> 00:04:33,278
Life goes on because obviously, as a multimillionaire sitting

77
00:04:33,294 --> 00:04:36,482
in a mansion, why the fuck do you care if people are complaining about things

78
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:40,346
you do on the Internet? It just doesn't matter, does it? But obviously, Pokemon made

79
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:43,606
me the classic mistake of addressing a controversy that she had

80
00:04:43,628 --> 00:04:47,286
no reason to even acknowledge, and in doing so, revealed how ridiculously out of

81
00:04:47,308 --> 00:04:50,902
touch she is with reality. Like, oh my God, $28 for cookies.

82
00:04:50,966 --> 00:04:54,314
Now let me first explain to you that you absolutely do not,

83
00:04:54,352 --> 00:04:57,674
as a multimillionaire influencer, ever, ever talk

84
00:04:57,712 --> 00:05:01,366
about money. Nothing you say regarding finances or money is going to be relevant

85
00:05:01,398 --> 00:05:05,002
to 99% of your audience. The audience who literally made you that money,

86
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:08,238
by the way. You don't have their problems with finances, you don't live in the

87
00:05:08,244 --> 00:05:11,742
same world as they do, and you've likely been so far away from that world

88
00:05:11,796 --> 00:05:15,134
for such a long time if you ever lived there in the first place,

89
00:05:15,252 --> 00:05:18,434
that you're entirely out of touch with it now. So don't pretend to have money

90
00:05:18,472 --> 00:05:21,826
struggles. Don't talk about how much money you have. Don't flex the amazing new

91
00:05:21,848 --> 00:05:25,666
lavish things that you've bought or done. Just leave the topic alone. No good can

92
00:05:25,688 --> 00:05:28,878
come from it. Ever. Pokamine, however, looked at

93
00:05:28,904 --> 00:05:32,406
people talking about her product, most of which were not her customers in the

94
00:05:32,428 --> 00:05:36,386
first place, and decided to address the whole situation with a broad stroke

95
00:05:36,498 --> 00:05:39,934
of nothing but stupidity, essentially shitting

96
00:05:40,002 --> 00:05:43,558
on every one of her audience who shared the criticism that the cookies

97
00:05:43,654 --> 00:05:46,806
are too expensive by calling them broke boys

98
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:50,714
for not wanting to buy her expensive influencer marked up products

99
00:05:50,832 --> 00:05:53,950
like if you're a broke boy, just say so. Anyways, moving on.

100
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,870
And of course, this is the same energy. You're broke,

101
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,998
you're fucking poor. Now, before we continue, just for context, here is

102
00:06:02,004 --> 00:06:05,554
another clip of pokey talking about money and how much of it she has.

103
00:06:05,672 --> 00:06:09,710
Why would I compromise my morals and ethics

104
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,790
for more money when I have money? Something about that is so cringe

105
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:17,506
to me personally. Obviously people started digging around her VODs and

106
00:06:17,528 --> 00:06:21,638
finding things, and the broke boy shit immediately set fire to this whole situation

107
00:06:21,804 --> 00:06:25,446
simply because Pokimane thought the best way to address criticism is to make

108
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:29,174
broad statements about anyone making that criticism. What made

109
00:06:29,212 --> 00:06:33,174
this all worse is that instead of just understanding that this was a glaring mistake

110
00:06:33,222 --> 00:06:37,414
and being a human being with a response to the shitstorm, Pokemon tried to style

111
00:06:37,462 --> 00:06:40,602
it off as a joke, when clearly anyone

112
00:06:40,656 --> 00:06:44,006
who has a functional brain can see and hear that this is

113
00:06:44,048 --> 00:06:47,566
not a joke, it's her actual feelings on the topic. To say

114
00:06:47,588 --> 00:06:51,230
this is a joke illustrates either she doesn't understand what a joke is,

115
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,974
wants to gaslight the entire population that does know what a joke is by saying

116
00:06:55,012 --> 00:06:58,194
it is one, or is going with the stupidest PR move

117
00:06:58,232 --> 00:07:01,538
possible when there's a real easy alternative. All she had to

118
00:07:01,544 --> 00:07:05,006
do at this point was to say yes, sorry guys, been getting slammed

119
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:08,546
on social media over this and I was frustrated. So I made a remark that

120
00:07:08,568 --> 00:07:11,926
I shouldn't have done, and upon reflecting on what I said, I understand it was

121
00:07:11,948 --> 00:07:15,202
wrong and I shouldn't have conveyed my thoughts in that way. My emotions

122
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:19,494
just got the better of me, a super easily understood human

123
00:07:19,612 --> 00:07:22,906
response, instead calling people broke boys and then

124
00:07:22,928 --> 00:07:27,226
saying Lol, I'm actually joking. Ha. XD it

125
00:07:27,248 --> 00:07:29,994
doesn't really work, does it? Now that's all I'm going to say on the whole

126
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:33,454
Pokimane what she said and did. Instead, I now want to talk about the

127
00:07:33,492 --> 00:07:37,114
Pokimane Defense Force and the elephant in the room. So buckle

128
00:07:37,162 --> 00:07:40,830
up, because this is where it gets wild. A Twitter user, and I believe

129
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,078
also a Twitch streamer, posted this in response to the

130
00:07:44,084 --> 00:07:47,762
backlash about Pokimane, not the cookie drama, but of course

131
00:07:47,816 --> 00:07:51,070
when she called her audience broke boys for not buying the cookies.

132
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,906
It says essentially that because some other bad content creators

133
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:58,486
who do bad things don't get dogpiled for doing so,

134
00:07:58,588 --> 00:08:02,962
people doing it to Pokemon for a slightly less bad thing are sexist

135
00:08:03,106 --> 00:08:06,200
and checks notes hates women.

136
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,810
Now obviously this tweet is patently false

137
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:13,658
in every single way, and aside from the fact I can read the words that

138
00:08:13,664 --> 00:08:17,290
are there in English and understand what they mean, it makes no real

139
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,170
sense from start to finish in any other way.

140
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,534
Firstly, the content creators she mentioned are some of

141
00:08:23,572 --> 00:08:27,290
the most criticized creators on the planet. There are literally

142
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:31,274
hundreds of videos about them, and some of these creators are actually deplatformed

143
00:08:31,322 --> 00:08:34,954
off most of the big social media sites. The idea that those people aren't

144
00:08:35,002 --> 00:08:38,594
being criticized for their actions is so wrong that in order

145
00:08:38,632 --> 00:08:41,778
to think so, you would either need to be unaware of who they are in

146
00:08:41,784 --> 00:08:45,038
the first place, making their example useless,

147
00:08:45,214 --> 00:08:48,614
or to ignore this fact in order to build a lie about

148
00:08:48,652 --> 00:08:52,386
what comes next. The framing is that people are criticizing

149
00:08:52,418 --> 00:08:56,118
Pokomane purely because she wants to sell cookies, which, as far as

150
00:08:56,124 --> 00:08:59,874
I'm aware, is a straw man. I've not forensically analyzed

151
00:08:59,922 --> 00:09:03,194
every account on social media in existence, but I've also not seen

152
00:09:03,232 --> 00:09:07,146
any highly upvoted, liked, or retweeted posts that do this.

153
00:09:07,248 --> 00:09:10,886
People criticized her for the price and for the white labeling that they likely

154
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:14,278
didn't understand, and not for the simple fact that she wanted to

155
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,934
sell cookies. If she said I'm going to sell cookies, and people went oh

156
00:09:17,972 --> 00:09:21,774
no, that's really bad, you shouldn't do that, that would mean they were criticizing the

157
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:25,374
choice and not the fact that people said, oh, they're too expensive, which means

158
00:09:25,412 --> 00:09:28,946
they're criticizing the price. Obviously both of the points here that

159
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:32,786
are made are already wrong, but both are only there to prop up this

160
00:09:32,808 --> 00:09:36,574
idea that to criticize someone for something is inherently sexist

161
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:40,262
just because they happen to be a woman for the sake of things.

162
00:09:40,396 --> 00:09:44,466
What is sexism? It's prejudice or discrimination based on sex.

163
00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:48,294
So she's saying you can't have an issue with what Pokimane said

164
00:09:48,412 --> 00:09:51,686
unless you hate women, which obviously is not how any

165
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:55,386
of this works. Now I will also say, just because this is a

166
00:09:55,408 --> 00:09:58,746
real thing, there are a lot of sexist gamers and a ton of people who

167
00:09:58,768 --> 00:10:02,094
will jump on any bandwagon against any woman for

168
00:10:02,132 --> 00:10:05,754
any reason because they are sexist. And that does exist.

169
00:10:05,882 --> 00:10:09,646
But that doesn't mean the actual core criticism means you

170
00:10:09,668 --> 00:10:12,938
are being sexist. If you use that core criticism,

171
00:10:13,114 --> 00:10:16,514
there will be sexist people who jumped at this opportunity and got involved. But that

172
00:10:16,552 --> 00:10:20,242
happens regardless. And labeling real complaints such as this as

173
00:10:20,296 --> 00:10:23,842
sexism does nothing but harm people who do experience real

174
00:10:23,896 --> 00:10:27,486
sexism based on their gender and not on complaints about a human's

175
00:10:27,518 --> 00:10:30,806
actions. And to illustrate that this isn't based on sex, you only have to

176
00:10:30,828 --> 00:10:34,086
look so far as any other content creator in history who has been

177
00:10:34,108 --> 00:10:37,666
criticized for similar practices, XQC flaunts his wealth by sending

178
00:10:37,698 --> 00:10:41,130
pictures of his expensive watch to H three h Three during

179
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,158
their disagreement, and of course gets rightfully, utterly shit

180
00:10:45,174 --> 00:10:48,506
on by the internet for being an out of touch clown about money.

181
00:10:48,608 --> 00:10:52,174
XQC responds to criticism about him making money, reacting to war

182
00:10:52,212 --> 00:10:55,406
footage, tweets a picture of him holding money to his

183
00:10:55,428 --> 00:10:59,130
ear with a suitcase full of cash. Again, complete criticism

184
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:03,034
from pretty much everybody for him doing this. Logan Paul

185
00:11:03,082 --> 00:11:06,446
sells Prime, you know, that drink that all the kids go wild

186
00:11:06,478 --> 00:11:09,806
for, and he of course gets utterly shit on when it's being overpriced

187
00:11:09,838 --> 00:11:13,806
in shops. In fact, you only have to be a content creator

188
00:11:13,838 --> 00:11:17,586
to know there's a vocal portion of everyone's audience that will utterly destroy

189
00:11:17,618 --> 00:11:21,110
you in your comment section or anywhere on the Internet for anything.

190
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:25,494
When it comes to making money, sponsors, merch products, anything you

191
00:11:25,532 --> 00:11:28,806
do, this is a common thing. For whatever reason,

192
00:11:28,908 --> 00:11:32,486
people don't want you making money. And if you make something and it's

193
00:11:32,518 --> 00:11:36,086
expensive or more expensive than other things, despite the fact you probably don't

194
00:11:36,118 --> 00:11:39,754
have all the infrastructure built up to make them cheaper in the first place,

195
00:11:39,952 --> 00:11:43,846
people will criticize you. It doesn't matter who you are, what you look like what's

196
00:11:43,878 --> 00:11:47,086
between your legs. This is nothing to do with gender, never was.

197
00:11:47,188 --> 00:11:50,734
So basically, we can add this to the list of things people turn into something

198
00:11:50,772 --> 00:11:54,266
it isn't, in order to push their very clear bias and agenda.

199
00:11:54,378 --> 00:11:58,110
Apparently no one can have legit criticisms about something someone does nowadays

200
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,082
without it being some form of prejudice or hatred if that person is

201
00:12:02,136 --> 00:12:06,210
a certain group, a concept that only harms when people experience

202
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,466
actual prejudice for real reasons.

203
00:12:09,598 --> 00:12:13,266
So realistically, this whole thing was a complete non issue until Pokimane

204
00:12:13,298 --> 00:12:16,806
made it an issue and started doing something she should have known better than to

205
00:12:16,828 --> 00:12:20,294
do. She's been a creating house for close to a decade, I believe. She's been

206
00:12:20,332 --> 00:12:24,626
through so many controversies and posted hall of Fame YouTuber apology videos regarding

207
00:12:24,658 --> 00:12:27,778
the things she's been caught doing, so it should very much confuse you when she's

208
00:12:27,794 --> 00:12:31,358
getting caught up in something so clearly stupid. It's a

209
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:35,386
classic case of letting your ego get in the way, something that these multi millionaire

210
00:12:35,418 --> 00:12:38,814
influencers seem to be incapable of escaping. But then again, I guess

211
00:12:38,852 --> 00:12:42,398
that's why people like Elon Musk buy Twitter. When you've got all the money in

212
00:12:42,404 --> 00:12:45,806
the world, what else do you have other than your vanity? But there

213
00:12:45,828 --> 00:12:49,130
we go. That's how Pokimane turned an absolutely nothing burger

214
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,050
into an indulgent family feast.
