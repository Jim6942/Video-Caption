1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,240
What's the range of revenue all this does? Over 600 million

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,000
a year. Yeah.

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,566
Basement. Meet Larry Janetsky, the blue collar billionaire. He has

4
00:00:11,588 --> 00:00:15,534
built one of the largest and most successful basement repair companies in

5
00:00:15,572 --> 00:00:19,022
America. He's invented revolutionary products that millions use

6
00:00:19,076 --> 00:00:22,590
across their home. He has a portfolio of blue collar businesses making

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,906
$650,000,000 a year. And he's

8
00:00:25,938 --> 00:00:29,474
achieved this all while working less than the average CEO.

9
00:00:29,602 --> 00:00:33,494
If you have to work 70 hours a week, you're doing it wrong. So today

10
00:00:33,532 --> 00:00:37,026
we're finding out what it takes to build a billion dollar blue collar empire.

11
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:41,006
You've been running this for 40 years? Well, I started when I was 17.

12
00:00:41,138 --> 00:00:45,690
And how much did you make your first year? I made $18,000

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,340
maybe, I don't know. I got a call when I was 18 years old.

14
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,946
Can you build a house for me? Yeah, but I'm 18

15
00:00:53,978 --> 00:00:57,214
years old, so if that's a problem,

16
00:00:57,332 --> 00:01:01,374
let me know in six weeks. Me, my friend who was 17 years

17
00:01:01,412 --> 00:01:04,890
old, and my younger brother who was 14 years old on summer vacation,

18
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:08,980
the three of us, you can't make this up. We built the house, and then

19
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,262
when we were done, the guy next door comes over says, can you build mine?

20
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,794
And then we built his, and the guy on the other side comes over,

21
00:01:15,832 --> 00:01:18,678
can you build mine? And that's it. I was off to the races. How does

22
00:01:18,684 --> 00:01:22,166
it feel when I say the phrase blue collar billionaires? It might be

23
00:01:22,188 --> 00:01:24,360
surprising to you, but hello,

24
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,946
before whatever, 1990, we didn't

25
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:32,114
have computers and there were people that did well before then.

26
00:01:32,172 --> 00:01:35,034
Okay, so tech isn't the only way to make money. Okay?

27
00:01:35,152 --> 00:01:38,426
You go to the store, you buy groceries, you go to a

28
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:42,154
mall, and you have all this retail. But the cool thing is about working

29
00:01:42,192 --> 00:01:45,754
with your hands is that you can never be replaced

30
00:01:45,802 --> 00:01:49,166
by AI. Amazon's not going to take over. Your job is

31
00:01:49,188 --> 00:01:52,190
not going to be offshored to India or anywhere else. Right?

32
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,646
Nobody can go in to a homeowner

33
00:01:55,678 --> 00:01:59,038
and fix their basement from Amazon

34
00:01:59,134 --> 00:02:02,482
or from India or. No robot is ever

35
00:02:02,536 --> 00:02:05,682
going to fix a crawl space. It's just not going to happen. Right.

36
00:02:05,736 --> 00:02:09,474
We need guys who are willing to get dirty.

37
00:02:09,602 --> 00:02:12,806
They know how to do what to do and why theY're there,

38
00:02:12,908 --> 00:02:15,990
and that's what we do. These guys are real men,

39
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,718
okay? You would see what these guys do. You would not believe it.

40
00:02:19,804 --> 00:02:23,594
You would not believe what these guys do. What do you mean? The work

41
00:02:23,632 --> 00:02:27,126
that they do, how hard work it is. Crawl space work. We go into crawl

42
00:02:27,158 --> 00:02:31,094
spaces that are this high and they got dead mice. And snake

43
00:02:31,142 --> 00:02:34,346
skins and bugs, and it's all mud under there.

44
00:02:34,448 --> 00:02:38,286
And they crawl in there. And when they leave, the end of the day,

45
00:02:38,388 --> 00:02:41,662
the customer could crawl in their pajamas and slide around.

46
00:02:41,796 --> 00:02:45,038
And these guys go into these very difficult environments

47
00:02:45,134 --> 00:02:48,434
every single day. And they make an

48
00:02:48,472 --> 00:02:52,002
incredibly, almost impossible job look

49
00:02:52,056 --> 00:02:55,362
easy. And we pay them very, very well.

50
00:02:55,496 --> 00:02:59,202
What's the range of salary? These guys make over $100,000

51
00:02:59,256 --> 00:03:03,046
a year because they earn it. It's hard to see this here, but he who

52
00:03:03,068 --> 00:03:06,486
works with his hands is a laborer. He who works with his hands and his

53
00:03:06,508 --> 00:03:09,670
head is a craftsman. He who works with his hands,

54
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,578
his head and his heart is an artist. From making

55
00:03:13,664 --> 00:03:17,446
$18,000 building homes to owning a 600 million dollar

56
00:03:17,478 --> 00:03:21,098
a year business, I had to find out what Larry's secret is.

57
00:03:21,184 --> 00:03:24,160
That's a big jump from here to $600 million a year.

58
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,402
You started. Hey, I'm just going to do basements.

59
00:03:27,466 --> 00:03:30,558
And just the demand was there. It's been 40 years,

60
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:34,574
okay, come on. We didn't make a big jump. We made

61
00:03:34,612 --> 00:03:37,394
a lot of little ones. There's a lot of business. People are looking for the

62
00:03:37,432 --> 00:03:40,650
quick hit. Right? I'm going to start this business. I'm going to

63
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,334
sell it in three years. Right. You're going in it with the wrong mindset.

64
00:03:44,382 --> 00:03:48,626
To begin with, my doctor energy saver business, I went five

65
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:52,006
and a half million dollars in the hole with no end to

66
00:03:52,028 --> 00:03:55,366
the losses in sight. And then my partner quit and sued me.

67
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:59,402
So what do I do? Do I quit? No. I kept going. Eleven years

68
00:03:59,456 --> 00:04:03,734
later, I made $1. Today it's very profitable.

69
00:04:03,862 --> 00:04:08,006
We're making houses more comfortable, more energy efficient.

70
00:04:08,118 --> 00:04:11,846
They burn less fossil fuels and electricity, and they're

71
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:15,754
less expensive to own. I've had a great, positive environmental impact

72
00:04:15,802 --> 00:04:19,246
on the world because I didn't quit. Do you have regrets about working too

73
00:04:19,268 --> 00:04:21,760
much? And was all this worth that?

74
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,546
I'm glad you asked, because I don't want people to think that I was

75
00:04:26,568 --> 00:04:30,206
the classic story of the busy business guy who was married

76
00:04:30,238 --> 00:04:33,442
to his business and worked so much and ignored his family.

77
00:04:33,496 --> 00:04:37,158
That is not the issue. And I haven't worked the weekend in 30 years.

78
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:40,614
If you have to work 70 hours a week, you're doing

79
00:04:40,652 --> 00:04:45,110
it wrong. You cannot ignore your family. You cannot ignore

80
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,694
having some fun in the beginning. You think it's about making money.

81
00:04:48,732 --> 00:04:51,818
You think it's about making a lot of money, right? I think that a lot

82
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:55,034
of business owners don't stick with it long enough to realize what it's really

83
00:04:55,072 --> 00:04:59,322
about. And it's not about the money. I don't get my self

84
00:04:59,376 --> 00:05:02,860
esteem from how much money I make. I get it from those people,

85
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,878
from them looking at me and saying, I trust you.

86
00:05:06,964 --> 00:05:10,398
At your funeral, nobody's going to say, oh, we had so much money,

87
00:05:10,484 --> 00:05:13,786
they don't care. It's the relationships and the good that you've

88
00:05:13,818 --> 00:05:17,442
done the footprint. Did you leave the world better than when you found it?

89
00:05:17,576 --> 00:05:21,042
That's what it's about. I've been working hard on my upcoming book,

90
00:05:21,096 --> 00:05:25,266
Million Dollar Weekend, which is coming out early 2024. Stay tuned. Looking through

91
00:05:25,288 --> 00:05:29,046
my notes, I found a lost chapter that is not in the final book.

92
00:05:29,148 --> 00:05:32,850
Very mysterious. It reveals things like how to double your income

93
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,434
without any new customers, how to create complementary

94
00:05:36,482 --> 00:05:40,082
products to generate more income. One solopreneur did this and made an extra

95
00:05:40,156 --> 00:05:43,526
$340,000. How to optimize Pricing Strategy

96
00:05:43,558 --> 00:05:47,034
and maximize profits and more. The Lost chapter is not

97
00:05:47,072 --> 00:05:51,054
online or Amazon or anywhere else. It is only for people on my

98
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:55,918
list like you. You can download it for free@Noahkagan.com.

99
00:05:56,004 --> 00:05:59,674
Slash lost. That's Noahkagan.com Slash lost.

100
00:05:59,722 --> 00:06:03,566
It's also below in the description. Alright, back to the video. A huge part

101
00:06:03,588 --> 00:06:07,406
of Larry's success that he downplayed in his early career was how serious

102
00:06:07,438 --> 00:06:11,140
he took having a positive mindset. You got a lot of your education

103
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:15,326
through motivational tapes. You got a lot of your learnings early on. I discovered

104
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:18,786
Nightingale Conan audio programs when I was 19 and it

105
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:22,066
changed my life. And I would listen to cassette tapes driving around in my truck

106
00:06:22,178 --> 00:06:24,854
and my friends would make fun of me,

107
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,640
listen to all that motivational crap and stuff.

108
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,770
So I kind of hid it from them for a long time.

109
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,554
But I wear those things out. Yeah.

110
00:06:34,672 --> 00:06:38,234
Brian Tracy and Earl Nightingale, he's like

111
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:41,966
father to me. And now it comes full circle as

112
00:06:41,988 --> 00:06:45,694
Larry has created his own motivational tapes to inspire others on their

113
00:06:45,732 --> 00:06:49,630
journey. Some people say I can't be successful

114
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,270
because I'm not talented.

115
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:54,640
Really,

116
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:00,386
I don't believe that. Now it was time for Larry to give me

117
00:07:00,408 --> 00:07:03,874
a tour of his $13 million office. And as he was taking me

118
00:07:03,912 --> 00:07:07,574
through, we met a few of his employees and I was blown away by how

119
00:07:07,612 --> 00:07:10,854
loyal they are to Larry. Michael, how long you've been here?

120
00:07:11,052 --> 00:07:14,834
Nine years November. All right. Nine years, November 14.

121
00:07:14,962 --> 00:07:18,246
Sue, how long you been here? Almost 20 years.

122
00:07:18,348 --> 00:07:21,350
Yeah. How long have you been here? 16 years. 16 years.

123
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:25,050
How long you have been here? Going to be 21 years.

124
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,586
What makes you want to stay? The people.

125
00:07:28,688 --> 00:07:32,426
Just the whole atmosphere of the company, the thing I

126
00:07:32,448 --> 00:07:34,750
don't understand, Larry. How are you so calm?

127
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:39,294
There's a saying flows uphill. All the problems that

128
00:07:39,332 --> 00:07:42,510
no one else could solve go up to the leader. I don't get those problems.

129
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,954
My phone doesn't ring, and it's on right now. I didn't turn it off because

130
00:07:45,992 --> 00:07:49,602
I have good people. So you need to create

131
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:53,026
a great team of people who stay. If you

132
00:07:53,048 --> 00:07:56,386
have continual turnover, nobody gets good at

133
00:07:56,408 --> 00:07:59,574
what they're doing. Right? And then you're constantly rebuilding your

134
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:03,446
company. If you turn everybody over, every 24 months,

135
00:08:03,628 --> 00:08:06,774
you have a brand new company. Every 24 months, you can never

136
00:08:06,812 --> 00:08:10,086
get traction. You're going to go for a ride in the world's slowest elevator.

137
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,786
No, come on. How did you learn your initial skills? I went

138
00:08:13,808 --> 00:08:17,734
to a technical high school. A regional vocational technical

139
00:08:17,782 --> 00:08:21,754
high school. I chose carpentry. Yeah. So I wasn't afraid

140
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:24,894
to cut wood and nail it together. So this

141
00:08:24,932 --> 00:08:28,826
is marketing. So they generate 15,000 leads

142
00:08:28,938 --> 00:08:32,766
a year. If Fatima gets a

143
00:08:32,788 --> 00:08:36,478
lead from the Internet, she's calling within 60 seconds. I just want

144
00:08:36,484 --> 00:08:39,954
to see the Google reviews. This is just so gooD. This is, like, so well

145
00:08:39,992 --> 00:08:44,238
run. Let's see what the customers say. Three days ago, five stars added

146
00:08:44,254 --> 00:08:47,782
a full bathroom to my basement. Tech professionals came on time.

147
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:51,794
High quality work. They put in a basement to make dehumidifier

148
00:08:51,842 --> 00:08:55,554
system. So all this is displays

149
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:59,398
of different products that we either manufacture

150
00:08:59,494 --> 00:09:03,194
or distribute to our

151
00:09:03,232 --> 00:09:07,210
dealers. I invented most of our key products.

152
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,678
We're basement waterproofing and crawl spaces. I have 32 patents.

153
00:09:10,774 --> 00:09:13,886
Can you show us some of those products? Yeah. This is a

154
00:09:13,908 --> 00:09:17,434
dehumidifier that my son designed. This is the most efficient,

155
00:09:17,482 --> 00:09:21,374
high performance dehumidifier in the world. My son also developed the

156
00:09:21,412 --> 00:09:26,482
world's best air purifier. He built this room that

157
00:09:26,536 --> 00:09:30,500
we would fill with smoke and watch it clear the air.

158
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,754
And we have videos on it to prove that

159
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:38,146
this is the world's best air purifier. We'd set up lasers in

160
00:09:38,168 --> 00:09:41,398
here so you could see the smoke. And we put

161
00:09:41,484 --> 00:09:44,886
every competitive air purifier in here and did the

162
00:09:44,908 --> 00:09:48,614
same test, and you could see the smoke go right through it with

163
00:09:48,652 --> 00:09:51,706
your own eyes. So this is boomtown. This is an 1880s

164
00:09:51,728 --> 00:09:55,706
mining town theme. So this is the boomtown mine, and this is what

165
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:59,580
the miners would have been going after here.

166
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:05,466
Plus, this is your stuff, too. Now, this is foam.

167
00:10:05,498 --> 00:10:09,566
Yeah. So I sprayed the foam and pushed them in. So we

168
00:10:09,588 --> 00:10:13,134
built all this, designed and built the whole thing. We're contractors,

169
00:10:13,182 --> 00:10:16,770
right? I'm so over tech.

170
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,882
This tech company sucks, dude. I'm being dirty hands

171
00:10:20,936 --> 00:10:24,690
messy. So this is a vintage industrial space,

172
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,270
and all the desks are, like 100 year old oak desks.

173
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:32,166
And all this stuff is most of all this stuff, including light

174
00:10:32,188 --> 00:10:35,526
fixtures, is from old factories and stuff. This is

175
00:10:35,548 --> 00:10:39,146
a sculpture of the business machine model. All my dealers walk in here,

176
00:10:39,168 --> 00:10:43,210
they know what that is, and it actually operates.

177
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,666
This was from Grand Central Station. Literally mailboxes

178
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:59,934
from Grand Central Station. This year, when someone says

179
00:10:59,972 --> 00:11:03,358
blue collar, how does that make you feel? Or what do you think when you

180
00:11:03,364 --> 00:11:06,730
hear that? For me, I've always been blue collar. I don't

181
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:10,302
think of it that way. I don't think that white collar is any better.

182
00:11:10,356 --> 00:11:14,766
I mean, you could have a guy who's a billionaire, but if

183
00:11:14,788 --> 00:11:18,182
his. His foundation's messed up. Who are you going to call now?

184
00:11:18,236 --> 00:11:21,846
Buddy, if you like

185
00:11:21,868 --> 00:11:25,206
this video, you are going to love this video. Right up here, where I talk

186
00:11:25,228 --> 00:11:28,502
to five millionaires over the age of 80 and ask them if the money

187
00:11:28,556 --> 00:11:31,846
was worth all the sacrifices they made. Make sure you

188
00:11:31,868 --> 00:11:35,826
subscribe to the channel if you are not already. We have some exciting billionaire interviews

189
00:11:35,858 --> 00:11:38,946
coming soon. Uncle Noah loves you, and I'll see you out there. Pew.
