1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,646
I wanted to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of you for

2
00:00:03,668 --> 00:00:06,846
your support. Over the last four years, we've grown into

3
00:00:06,868 --> 00:00:10,394
an international team of 15 people. We have loved producing

4
00:00:10,442 --> 00:00:14,366
battle map animations for you and we love hearing how much you enjoy them.

5
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:18,122
We do our absolute best to offer accurate and unbiased recreations

6
00:00:18,186 --> 00:00:22,442
of the most important battles and operations of the 20th and 21st centuries.

7
00:00:22,586 --> 00:00:25,526
I hope we've done a relatively good job at this. However,

8
00:00:25,628 --> 00:00:29,554
you may have also been following the recent changes in YouTube monetization rules

9
00:00:29,602 --> 00:00:32,886
that is often demonetizing our videos. With a team of

10
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:36,918
people relying on this monetization, this has become a major challenge for us.

11
00:00:37,084 --> 00:00:41,106
Shorts now take up valuable space on the YouTube homepage that would ordinarily

12
00:00:41,138 --> 00:00:44,426
be used to recommend our long form content. We are

13
00:00:44,448 --> 00:00:48,106
also censored from covering certain topics. As just one example,

14
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:51,754
certain conflicts involving certain militant groups in

15
00:00:51,792 --> 00:00:55,290
certain Middle Eastern places over the last 20 years get demonetized,

16
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,814
preventing us from covering major events in recent military history.

17
00:00:59,012 --> 00:01:02,654
When videos are demonetized, it's YouTube policy to specifically not tell

18
00:01:02,692 --> 00:01:06,218
us the reason in case we don't do that thing again or something.

19
00:01:06,404 --> 00:01:09,854
With that in mind, this video is sponsored by our new and updated

20
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:13,938
Patreon. We've got lots of exciting new benefits and are creating a community

21
00:01:14,024 --> 00:01:17,794
where we can interact with you more directly. We're uploading all

22
00:01:17,832 --> 00:01:21,222
videos completely ad and sponsor free. We've launched a new Q

23
00:01:21,276 --> 00:01:24,694
A series on the Intel Report, where Patreons can directly ask

24
00:01:24,732 --> 00:01:28,360
the follow up questions to the operations room on the intel report videos.

25
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,346
We'll be featuring your reactions and comments to early releases on

26
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:35,834
the videos themselves when they later upload to YouTube. You'll also

27
00:01:35,872 --> 00:01:39,638
gain access to Patreon only events, competitions and giveaways.

28
00:01:39,814 --> 00:01:42,938
We'll continue to commit to our YouTube release schedule as is,

29
00:01:43,024 --> 00:01:46,202
but we will also be able to release videos on censored topics

30
00:01:46,266 --> 00:01:49,070
and videos that have been demonetized on Patreon.

31
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:53,038
Absolutely no pressure at all. But if you would like to support us, it would

32
00:01:53,044 --> 00:01:56,606
be amazing. Please take a look at the link in the description and pinned comment

33
00:01:56,638 --> 00:02:00,050
below. No problem at all. If not, we appreciate all of your support.

34
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,074
Since April 20,

35
00:02:01,112 --> 00:02:05,394
1914 B

36
00:02:05,432 --> 00:02:08,718
52 H Stratofortress Strategic bombers begin rolling

37
00:02:08,734 --> 00:02:12,086
down the runway at RAF Fairfords in the United Kingdom at just

38
00:02:12,108 --> 00:02:16,086
before 01:00 p.m. Local time on 21 March 2003.

39
00:02:16,268 --> 00:02:19,670
The crews of the aircraft queuing on the taxiway wave small American

40
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,610
flags out their windows before joining the main runway,

41
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,138
drawing tears from the ground. Crews the B 52s are

42
00:02:26,144 --> 00:02:30,262
on their way to their target, Baghdad. There they will join coalition

43
00:02:30,326 --> 00:02:34,030
aircraft to bring shock and awe to Saddam Hussein's military.

44
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,602
Four B Two Spirit stealth bombers and a further 14

45
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:42,218
B 52s also take off from the British base at Diego

46
00:02:42,234 --> 00:02:46,026
Garcia in the Indian Ocean. Like the B 52s flying

47
00:02:46,058 --> 00:02:50,020
from the U. K, these aircraft are en route to the operational area

48
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,894
aboard the aircraft carrier USS Constellation. Captain Mark Fox

49
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:58,786
has briefed the pilots of Carrier Wing Two, whose 20 FA

50
00:02:58,818 --> 00:03:02,386
18 C Hornet strike aircraft are part of the first wave heading

51
00:03:02,418 --> 00:03:05,798
into Baghdad. Due to press reporters listening in on the

52
00:03:05,804 --> 00:03:09,414
briefings, box and his subordinates are careful not to disclose

53
00:03:09,462 --> 00:03:13,126
sensitive information while also giving their men a clear picture

54
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:16,410
of what to expect before sending them to their aircraft.

55
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,238
The liftoff from the carrier's flight deck is smooth and the Hornets climb

56
00:03:21,254 --> 00:03:24,414
to 18,000ft en routes to meet their tankers over

57
00:03:24,452 --> 00:03:28,250
northern Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, strike aircraft,

58
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:32,346
strategic bombers, wild weasels, tankers, electronic warfare

59
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,954
aircraft, recon aircraft and drones begin launching from air

60
00:03:35,992 --> 00:03:39,246
bases across the Middle east and from five aircraft carriers

61
00:03:39,278 --> 00:03:42,658
in the Persian Gulf. By the end of the first day,

62
00:03:42,744 --> 00:03:46,190
1700 sorties will have been launched against Iraq,

63
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,634
about 60% of the number during the first day of the air War of Desert

64
00:03:49,682 --> 00:03:53,714
Storm. The first wave is to launch a coordinated

65
00:03:53,762 --> 00:03:57,858
attack into Baghdad at 09:00 p.m. Local time each hour.

66
00:03:58,044 --> 00:04:01,302
Hundreds of strike aircraft will then immediately join the aerial

67
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,806
assault across Iraq, hitting Iraqi army and Republican

68
00:04:04,838 --> 00:04:08,330
Guard targets, SAM sites and military infrastructure.

69
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,542
This operation was originally intended to mark the official start

70
00:04:12,596 --> 00:04:16,398
of Operation Iraqi Freedom, with the ground invasion following on

71
00:04:16,404 --> 00:04:19,866
the morning of 22nd. Instead, US Fifth

72
00:04:19,898 --> 00:04:23,802
Corps and the first Marine Expeditionary Force have crossed the Iraqi border

73
00:04:23,866 --> 00:04:27,746
24 hours early after concern that Saddam Hussein's government would

74
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:31,086
wage a scorched earth campaign. Saddam's generals

75
00:04:31,118 --> 00:04:34,770
are caught off guard by this strategy. They had been expecting another

76
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,226
long and sustained aerial barrage similar to the one they had faced

77
00:04:38,258 --> 00:04:41,426
in the five weeks before the land defensive of Operation Desert

78
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:44,646
Storm. With the Iraqi military knocked back on

79
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:48,194
its heels, the leader of Central Command, General Tommy Franks,

80
00:04:48,242 --> 00:04:51,270
and the Air War commander, Major General Buz Mosley,

81
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:55,674
decide to proceed with the first day of the planned air offensive. A day

82
00:04:55,872 --> 00:04:59,686
the objective is to clear out enemy air defenses and decisively

83
00:04:59,718 --> 00:05:03,258
cripple the barfist regime. Unlike at the beginning

84
00:05:03,274 --> 00:05:06,922
of Desert Storm, the coalition has already won air superiority

85
00:05:06,986 --> 00:05:10,270
over Iraq with months of preparatory airstrikes.

86
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,534
When planning for Iraqi freedom began, General Mosley estimated

87
00:05:14,602 --> 00:05:17,886
that his air forces would need ten to 14 days to pummel

88
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,060
Saddam's air defenses before the invasion could start.

89
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:25,234
General Franks was unhappy with this. He believed the Lightning war

90
00:05:25,272 --> 00:05:28,710
on the ground should be supported by a lightning war in the sky.

91
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,718
Instead, Operation Southern Focus was authorized. In 2002,

92
00:05:33,884 --> 00:05:37,906
Royal Air Force and United States Air Force aircraft methodically bomb

93
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:42,330
Iraqi air defenses over the no fly zone below the 33rd parallel.

94
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,854
Between March and December 2002, the number of bombs

95
00:05:46,902 --> 00:05:50,274
dropped by the RAF and USAF on Iraq increased

96
00:05:50,342 --> 00:05:54,362
by 300%. The suppression missions

97
00:05:54,426 --> 00:05:57,626
became so routine that ref Tornado pilots began

98
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:00,190
referring to them as recreational bombing.

99
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,922
However, not all enemy air defenses have been suppressed.

100
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:08,402
The air defenses in the area of central Iraq did not fall under

101
00:06:08,456 --> 00:06:11,934
either the northern or southern no fly zones established during Desert

102
00:06:11,982 --> 00:06:15,650
Storm and have not been targeted by interwar strikes.

103
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:19,974
Coalition intelligence has identified over 200 threats within this

104
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:23,382
area, including Sovietbuilt SA Two, SA three,

105
00:06:23,436 --> 00:06:27,254
and SA six launches, French made Rolands, and even an

106
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:30,838
American produced Hawk SAm Battery, which was captured by the Iraqi

107
00:06:30,854 --> 00:06:34,140
army during the invasion of Kuwait in 1991.

108
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,426
A main objective for Airwall Commander General Mosley will

109
00:06:38,448 --> 00:06:41,866
be the elimination of AA capability in this area, which has

110
00:06:41,888 --> 00:06:45,930
been named the supermissile Engagement Zone, or supermeVs.

111
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:50,186
While the strike aircraft are assembling, General Franks addresses

112
00:06:50,218 --> 00:06:53,738
his subordinates by video call from his headquarters in Qatar,

113
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:56,978
telling them shock will be introduced at 2100.

114
00:06:57,064 --> 00:07:00,206
You're all doing great. At General Mosley's

115
00:07:00,238 --> 00:07:03,486
command post in Saudi Arabia and aboard the US Navy carriers

116
00:07:03,518 --> 00:07:07,890
in the Persian Gulf, air controllers are closely monitoring the strike groups.

117
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:12,086
The mission planners have created threedimensional highways in the

118
00:07:12,108 --> 00:07:15,640
sky to minimize any midair collisions or friendly fire.

119
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,914
These highways require incoming aircraft to fly on the right hand

120
00:07:19,952 --> 00:07:22,860
side, while egressing aircraft fly to the left.

121
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,586
These paths are to be strictly followed by the aviators as

122
00:07:26,608 --> 00:07:30,866
they fly into enemy airspace. An aerial innovation

123
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:34,910
will help the coalition improve over its performance from Desert Storm.

124
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,954
Both the United States and United Kingdom have since built fleets

125
00:07:39,002 --> 00:07:42,622
of UAVs, which can provide valuable intelligence without putting

126
00:07:42,676 --> 00:07:46,062
their operators in danger. A year earlier,

127
00:07:46,126 --> 00:07:49,726
the US Air Force unsuccessfully attempted to shoot down an Iraqi

128
00:07:49,758 --> 00:07:53,326
MiG 25 using a predator drone. But the episode spooked

129
00:07:53,358 --> 00:07:56,630
Iraqi High Command into ceasing aerial patrols.

130
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:01,346
In preparation for a day, unarmed Predator drones have been loitering

131
00:08:01,378 --> 00:08:04,470
above Baghdad to document enemy air defenses.

132
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:10,778
At just before 09:00 p.m. Navy Special Mission C 130s

133
00:08:10,864 --> 00:08:14,730
drop three fire B target drones and peel away. While the drones continue

134
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,726
on a predictable heading towards Baghdad. These drones

135
00:08:18,758 --> 00:08:22,602
are to act as decoys and draw the attention of Iraqi air defenses

136
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,590
away from the incoming raids.

137
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,846
Arriving on station simultaneously, the B 52s

138
00:08:28,868 --> 00:08:32,426
from the UK and from Diego Garcia fulfill a similar task

139
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,774
to their first actions during Desert Storm. The Strata

140
00:08:35,822 --> 00:08:39,202
Fortresses launch 100 AGM 86 C cruise

141
00:08:39,256 --> 00:08:43,502
missiles from both the northwest and southeast of Iraq, the largest

142
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:46,180
air launched cruise missile attack in history.

143
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,914
The strata fortresses turn for home while the US Navy warships

144
00:08:50,962 --> 00:08:54,630
in the Persian Gulf launch Tomahawk missiles. A day

145
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:59,050
will see 504 cruise missile strikes against regime targets.

146
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:04,602
The first strike on Baghdad will come in three waves and attack over 100

147
00:09:04,656 --> 00:09:08,726
targets in the capital. While the fire B target drones

148
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:12,526
distract the antiaircraft batteries around the city. The cruise missiles will

149
00:09:12,548 --> 00:09:15,754
strike Barthis targets and Republican Guard command posts

150
00:09:15,802 --> 00:09:18,320
to further draw Iraqi antiaircraft fire.

151
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:23,546
They will then be followed by twelve F 117 Nighthawks supported

152
00:09:23,578 --> 00:09:27,390
by ten EA six B Prowlers, which will jam enemy radars.

153
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:31,394
If the Prowlers detect Iraqi fire control radars, eight F

154
00:09:31,432 --> 00:09:34,606
16 CJ Wild weasels will be vectored to destroy

155
00:09:34,638 --> 00:09:37,590
the enemy with radar seeking harm missiles.

156
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,670
Four B, two stealth bombers, 20 FA, eighteen S,

157
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,094
eight F, fourteen S and eight F fifteen E's will

158
00:09:45,132 --> 00:09:48,906
follow in to hit targets in the city after the Iraqi air defenses have

159
00:09:48,928 --> 00:09:52,746
been exhausted. Immediately following the initial attack in

160
00:09:52,768 --> 00:09:56,374
Baghdad, hundreds of strike aircraft will execute their planned

161
00:09:56,422 --> 00:09:59,900
missions to attack military installations across the country.

162
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,730
The B One B Lancers will act as socalled roving linebackers,

163
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:08,366
patrolling Iraqi airspace and awaiting the order to unleash their

164
00:10:08,388 --> 00:10:10,400
munitions on targets of opportunity.

165
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:15,634
More airstrikes by RAF Tornadoes and B One B's will

166
00:10:15,672 --> 00:10:18,786
simultaneously target what remains of Iraq's air force and

167
00:10:18,808 --> 00:10:21,170
SAM capabilities around the Supermez.

168
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,446
Altogether, the A day strike aircraft will carry out

169
00:10:25,468 --> 00:10:29,190
more than 1700 sorties against Saddam's regime.

170
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,410
The Fire B target drones launched earlier arrive over Baghdad

171
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,366
and have their intended effect. Iraqi radar teams

172
00:10:39,398 --> 00:10:43,290
take the bait and switch on their radar sets to lock onto the drones.

173
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,530
Antiaircraft fire erupts wildly into the night sky.

174
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,570
Once the drones are within the city limits, they release aluminium chaff strips.

175
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,390
Scrambling Iraqi radar sets even further.

176
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:00,366
At exactly 09:00 p.m.. H hour, the first AGMs and

177
00:11:00,388 --> 00:11:04,014
Tomahawks scream into Baghdad. Just as

178
00:11:04,052 --> 00:11:08,530
planned, the Iraqi defenders open fire with all the weapons at their disposal.

179
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:12,446
Like in 1991, news organizations have trained

180
00:11:12,478 --> 00:11:15,646
their cameras on the city and broadcast the opening salvo

181
00:11:15,678 --> 00:11:17,800
of the air offensive live to the world.

182
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,946
This time, none of the bridges over the Euphrates or Tigris

183
00:11:22,978 --> 00:11:26,642
rivers are bombed, as the American forces will soon need these crossings.

184
00:11:26,706 --> 00:11:30,074
In their drive northwest. With new

185
00:11:30,112 --> 00:11:33,174
intelligence on the dire state of Iraqi infrastructure,

186
00:11:33,302 --> 00:11:36,410
electricity and water systems will also be spared.

187
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:40,646
Thus, those watching at home are treated to the strange sight

188
00:11:40,678 --> 00:11:43,806
of downtown Baghdad being hit by cruise missiles while

189
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,790
the city is still fully lit.

190
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:51,146
The night before, the Bush administration removed over 500 targets

191
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:54,754
from the strike list, worried that Saddam's government might collapse too

192
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:57,410
quickly and leave the country in anarchy.

193
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:02,754
While the cruise missiles are pummeling Baghdad, the F 117s

194
00:12:02,792 --> 00:12:06,226
have encountered a problem because of

195
00:12:06,248 --> 00:12:09,874
the large number of aircraft involved in the operation. All KC

196
00:12:09,922 --> 00:12:13,314
Ten, KC 130 and KC 135 tankers

197
00:12:13,362 --> 00:12:17,234
are swamped by refueling missions, and nine of the twelve nighthawks

198
00:12:17,282 --> 00:12:21,126
have been unable to tank on schedule. Only the three remaining F

199
00:12:21,148 --> 00:12:23,720
117s have continued to bag down.

200
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,326
Once the city is in sight, they split up and prepare to execute.

201
00:12:28,358 --> 00:12:31,866
Their attack runs from different directions to dilute enemy AA

202
00:12:31,898 --> 00:12:35,434
fire. Colonel Matthew McKeown, Major Stephen

203
00:12:35,482 --> 00:12:39,470
Anchorstar, and Captain Brent Blake seek out their target.

204
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:44,430
Anchorstar is flying in from the northeast and locates his first target,

205
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:48,210
an Iraqi army communications array to the north of Baghdad.

206
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:52,334
At 917 pm, he drops a single bomb on the complex,

207
00:12:52,382 --> 00:12:56,686
which detonates right on target. The F 117 continues

208
00:12:56,718 --> 00:12:59,794
south to the city itself, which is now covered in smoke.

209
00:12:59,842 --> 00:13:04,230
Following the cruise missile strikes, he then drops a GBU 27

210
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,878
earth penetrating bomb on a four way intersection rumored

211
00:13:07,894 --> 00:13:11,846
to have a military tunnel running beneath it. He egresses south

212
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:15,414
as his aircraft avoids inaccurate antiaircraft fire and SAM

213
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:18,954
launches the oncepaunted air defenses around

214
00:13:18,992 --> 00:13:21,920
the Iraqi capital. Do not score a single hit.

215
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,646
Colonel McKeown spots his target, the massive dome of the

216
00:13:25,668 --> 00:13:29,230
Bath Party national headquarters. He drops a single

217
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,694
2000 pound bomb, which penetrates the building and explodes,

218
00:13:32,762 --> 00:13:36,126
collapsing the dome. McKeown heads

219
00:13:36,158 --> 00:13:39,966
north and drops another bomb on the same communications array. Anchors star struck

220
00:13:39,998 --> 00:13:42,020
earlier before turning for home.

221
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:47,042
Finally, Captain Blake drops both his bombs on another regime target

222
00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:50,310
in downtown Baghdad before also turning south,

223
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,446
obliging General Frank's order that the air forces should keep the heat on.

224
00:13:55,548 --> 00:13:59,118
The B two Spirit stealth bombers arrive to continue the barrage.

225
00:13:59,154 --> 00:14:01,530
As the F 117s are departing,

226
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:06,054
the stealth bombers quickly get to work. A B two drops

227
00:14:06,102 --> 00:14:09,894
two 4700 pound GBU 37 satellite

228
00:14:09,942 --> 00:14:13,630
guided bunker busters on an Iraqi communications tower.

229
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,534
The base of the tower explodes in a massive fireball and

230
00:14:17,572 --> 00:14:21,406
the entire structure collapses. The B two can carry up

231
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:25,214
to 16 JDAM precision guided bombs, 16 JSAO glide

232
00:14:25,262 --> 00:14:29,250
bombs, or eight GBU 37 bunker buster bombs.

233
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:33,646
All of these weapons are deployed on this night. Saddam's lavish

234
00:14:33,678 --> 00:14:37,538
palaces in the Iraqi capital are systematically reduced to rubble by the

235
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,918
B two S at 11:00 p.m. Local time

236
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:44,902
the remaining conventional strike fighters in the Baghdad force move

237
00:14:44,956 --> 00:14:49,094
in to hit their targets. It is also at this time that the conventional

238
00:14:49,142 --> 00:14:52,746
strike fighters and strategic bombers that are now flooding into Iraq to

239
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:56,810
hit military targets across the country also begin their mass assault.

240
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,934
With Iraqi military command isolated and in chaos, the F

241
00:15:01,972 --> 00:15:05,466
16 CJ Vipers begin the dirty work of suppression

242
00:15:05,498 --> 00:15:09,594
of enemy air defenses or seed. Seed missions

243
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:13,154
are among the most demanding. Faced by pilots known as

244
00:15:13,192 --> 00:15:16,814
wild weasels, the seed aircraft must fly in close coordination

245
00:15:16,862 --> 00:15:20,334
with the strike aircraft and remain constantly vigilant in monitoring

246
00:15:20,382 --> 00:15:24,286
enemy radar activity. These exhausting

247
00:15:24,318 --> 00:15:27,954
flights can last anywhere between six to 12 hours and require

248
00:15:28,002 --> 00:15:31,670
as many as ten midair refuelings to remain on station over the area

249
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,222
of operations. However, the United States

250
00:15:35,276 --> 00:15:38,458
Air Force employs the most modern seed tactics along with the

251
00:15:38,464 --> 00:15:42,474
feared harm missiles. Once an enemy radar set is

252
00:15:42,512 --> 00:15:46,358
detected, the F 16s engage the target with harms missiles

253
00:15:46,374 --> 00:15:48,700
which lock onto the radar emissions themselves.

254
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:53,386
With Iraqi radar sites continuing to try to illuminate American aircraft

255
00:15:53,418 --> 00:15:58,254
over Baghdad, the environment is target rich for the F

256
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:01,662
wild weasel pilot later brags, the Iraqis knew for sure

257
00:16:01,716 --> 00:16:04,306
that if they came on the air they were going to get a face full

258
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:08,002
of harm. With the skies clear

259
00:16:08,056 --> 00:16:11,246
of enemy aircraft and the Vipers destroying any Iraqi

260
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:14,926
radar that illuminates, Captain Fox leads a flight of four FA

261
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,434
eighteen s to their target, an enemy surface to surface missile

262
00:16:18,482 --> 00:16:21,510
site just outside Baghdad's southern suburbs.

263
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,746
While en route to the objective, Fox watches the aerial fireworks

264
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:29,478
from the cockpit of his Hornet as SAM and tracer rounds arc through the

265
00:16:29,484 --> 00:16:32,566
night sky above the city, which is still fully lit.

266
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:36,166
He later recalled Baghdad's light and the building crescendo

267
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:40,090
of explosions were almost too bright to view through night vision goggles.

268
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:44,542
Each Hornet in the flight is carrying three AGM 154

269
00:16:44,596 --> 00:16:48,506
Joint standoff weapons, or JSOs. These fire and forget glide

270
00:16:48,538 --> 00:16:52,030
bombs are the perfect weapon to knock out the Iraqi missiles.

271
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:57,214
When the four Hornets reach the JSOW launch point, each AGM

272
00:16:57,262 --> 00:17:00,574
154 releases from the underside of the aircraft with a thunk

273
00:17:00,622 --> 00:17:04,354
sound. Guided by sophisticated avionics using

274
00:17:04,392 --> 00:17:08,146
GPS tracking, the JSOWS glide towards their targets.

275
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:12,630
Within a minute, all twelve explode and demolish the missile launchers.

276
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:16,246
The Hornets bank to the right as Captain Fox is treated to

277
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:19,858
a unique sight. Below him, he spots a sea of sparkles,

278
00:17:19,954 --> 00:17:23,766
almost as if there are people taking flash photographs from the ground.

279
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:27,654
He realizes that it is actually hundreds of Iraqi soldiers firing

280
00:17:27,702 --> 00:17:30,490
AKS straight up into the air at his aircraft.

281
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:34,254
Fox later remarks, I thought to myself this would be a bad

282
00:17:34,292 --> 00:17:37,834
night to go low. As the flight egresses south,

283
00:17:37,882 --> 00:17:41,690
he looks back one more time to take in the spectacle of the air campaign.

284
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:45,170
The Iraqi defenses were spectacular but ineffective.

285
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:50,286
Another flight of four Hornets, including two from Marine Squadron

286
00:17:50,318 --> 00:17:54,286
323 from the USS Constellation, are about to reach their targets

287
00:17:54,318 --> 00:17:57,314
in the town of Kabala. However,

288
00:17:57,432 --> 00:18:00,866
this mission is facing difficulty, as the four Vipers tasked

289
00:18:00,898 --> 00:18:02,950
with defending the Hornets are late.

290
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:07,126
Commander Mark Hubbard and the rest of the flight are circling to wait for

291
00:18:07,148 --> 00:18:10,694
them when he also learns that the Prowler electronic jamming aircraft

292
00:18:10,742 --> 00:18:13,702
is also missing. Running out of fuel,

293
00:18:13,766 --> 00:18:18,140
Hubbard knows he must abort if his support aircraft cannot arrive on time

294
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,894
yet. With less than two minutes to spare, the Vipers arrive,

295
00:18:21,942 --> 00:18:24,830
and Hubbard gives the go ahead to continue the mission.

296
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:28,846
Two Marine Hornets split off to bomb a communications array just to the

297
00:18:28,868 --> 00:18:32,586
west, while Hubbard and his wingman head for their target, a barracks

298
00:18:32,618 --> 00:18:36,610
complex in Kabbalah, which is a training complex for Saddam Hussein's personal

299
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,286
bodyguards. Ribbons of Iraqi antiaircraft

300
00:18:40,318 --> 00:18:44,930
tracers lace through the sky and bracket the two Hornets, who continue undeterred

301
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:49,494
at the release point. They each drop 2000 pound JDAMs before

302
00:18:49,532 --> 00:18:52,914
turning for the Persian Gulf. Their munitions explode

303
00:18:52,962 --> 00:18:56,678
right on target. Despite the heavy AA fire, none of

304
00:18:56,684 --> 00:18:59,530
the Hornets in the flight have taken any battle damage.

305
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,182
Meanwhile, RAF Tornadoes join the fray.

306
00:19:04,326 --> 00:19:07,866
Four Tornado GR Four S of nine squadron are screaming towards the

307
00:19:07,888 --> 00:19:10,750
Iraqi city of Al Qut. On a seed mission,

308
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:15,194
Flight Lieutenant Andy Robbins and his weapon system officer,

309
00:19:15,242 --> 00:19:18,830
Lieutenant Dave Williams, are the second aircraft in the formation.

310
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,422
Each tornado is carrying a single aim nine L sidewinder,

311
00:19:23,486 --> 00:19:27,726
a chaff countermeasure pod, 600 gallon drop tanks, and five alarm

312
00:19:27,758 --> 00:19:31,534
antiradar missiles. Robbins and Williams

313
00:19:31,582 --> 00:19:35,234
receive a warning telling them that their aircraft's avionics cooling system has

314
00:19:35,272 --> 00:19:38,834
failed, followed quickly by another, informing the men that the radar

315
00:19:38,882 --> 00:19:41,910
homing and warning receiver has also malfunctioned.

316
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:46,994
Despite the cascading failures, Robbins closes up to the lead aircraft

317
00:19:47,042 --> 00:19:50,618
to effectively share their warning receiver. They detect a

318
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:54,662
Roland SAM fire control radar set lighting up to search for targets,

319
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:57,930
and the Tornado achieves lock with the alarm missiles.

320
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,650
Four of the five missiles launch while the aircraft egresses south.

321
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:07,294
The alarms smash the radar, and there is little anti aircraft fire

322
00:20:07,492 --> 00:20:10,778
as they return to base, Robbins is in awe of the columns

323
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:14,130
of Coalition ground forces below them advancing north.

324
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:17,966
He watches them through his night vision goggles and later recalls,

325
00:20:18,078 --> 00:20:21,490
every road into Iraq was simply rammed with green dots.

326
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,254
At the same time, two pairs of Tornadoes from six one

327
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:31,094
seven squadron are about to showcase their MBDA Storm Shadow cruise

328
00:20:31,132 --> 00:20:34,514
missiles for the first time an Anglo

329
00:20:34,562 --> 00:20:38,098
French bunker busting cruise missile, the storm Shadow can be air launched

330
00:20:38,114 --> 00:20:42,006
by Tornadoes, delivering 450 high explosive

331
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:45,798
warheads up to 350 miles and through the roofs of hardened

332
00:20:45,814 --> 00:20:49,382
aircraft shelters and bunkers. Nine Squadron,

333
00:20:49,446 --> 00:20:52,874
the same unit which sank the German battleship turpits with six one

334
00:20:52,912 --> 00:20:56,458
seven squadron 60 years earlier, launched their missiles at hardened

335
00:20:56,474 --> 00:21:00,350
Iraqi Air Defense Command bunkers in Taji and Tikrit.

336
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:04,146
They follow with alarm missiles against radar sites across the

337
00:21:04,168 --> 00:21:07,726
country. The B one B Lancer

338
00:21:07,758 --> 00:21:11,138
strategic bombers orbit the airspace, each aircraft armed with a

339
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,410
payload of 24 JDAMs.

340
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,766
When given the signal by the air controllers, the Lancers pounce on

341
00:21:17,788 --> 00:21:21,154
targets of opportunity. The supersonic bombers

342
00:21:21,202 --> 00:21:23,560
face little to no antiaircraft fire.

343
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:29,154
However, they do not hit many Iraqi aircraft, which are conspicuously

344
00:21:29,202 --> 00:21:32,570
absent from their airfields. It is later

345
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,618
discovered that the Iraqis buried much of their remaining MiGs and mirages in

346
00:21:36,624 --> 00:21:40,140
the desert to keep them from being destroyed in the initial attack.

347
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:44,794
This is also because Saddam believes the coalition will fail to depose

348
00:21:44,842 --> 00:21:48,670
him, and he hopes to reactivate his air force once they have withdrawn.

349
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:54,846
Four F 15 E Strike Eagles from the 336 Tactical Fighter

350
00:21:54,878 --> 00:21:58,930
Squadron are tasked with dealing a personal blow to the Iraqi dictator.

351
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:03,582
Nicknamed the Rocketeers, the Strike Eagles are approaching Baghdad

352
00:22:03,646 --> 00:22:07,254
to attack Saddam Hussein's Yacht Club. At the same

353
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:11,122
time, four strike Eagles from the 330 5th Tactical Fighter Squadron.

354
00:22:11,186 --> 00:22:14,806
The chiefs are en route to destroy the Republican Guard Barracks at

355
00:22:14,828 --> 00:22:18,466
Saddam International Airport. These attacks

356
00:22:18,498 --> 00:22:21,946
are intended to make it harder for Saddam to flee the country before he can

357
00:22:21,968 --> 00:22:25,546
be captured. However, the mission is

358
00:22:25,568 --> 00:22:28,954
already not going according to plan. One of the 330

359
00:22:28,992 --> 00:22:32,438
5th Strike Eagles suffered an air to ground missile failure while

360
00:22:32,464 --> 00:22:36,190
still on the ground, leaving only three to complete the mission.

361
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:40,366
When the F 15 E's are in range of the airport, another one of

362
00:22:40,388 --> 00:22:43,598
the AGMs fails to launch. Two of the

363
00:22:43,604 --> 00:22:47,086
strike Eagles manage to launch their missiles, but one explodes

364
00:22:47,118 --> 00:22:51,442
only seconds after leaving the aircraft. Only one AGM 130

365
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:54,610
impacts the target but causes only minor damage.

366
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:59,206
The rocketeers fare even worse. None of the AGM missiles hit

367
00:22:59,228 --> 00:23:01,720
the yacht club due to a data link problem.

368
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:05,986
The failure of these missions will lead to increased scrutiny of the AGM

369
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:09,438
130, which has gained a reputation for being unreliable.

370
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,980
Not that Saddam's yacht collection will mind.

371
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:16,934
Two F 14 D Tomcats of VF two and a pair of FA

372
00:23:16,982 --> 00:23:20,566
18 C Hornets from VFA 137 are approaching

373
00:23:20,598 --> 00:23:24,326
their target. The Iraqi Ministry of Defense's radio relay transmitter

374
00:23:24,358 --> 00:23:27,518
at Salman Pack, a heavily defended town southeast of

375
00:23:27,524 --> 00:23:30,766
Baghdad. The missions over Baghdad tonight are

376
00:23:30,788 --> 00:23:34,514
the first non stealth attacks against a target in the Baghdad area since

377
00:23:34,552 --> 00:23:38,020
the ill fated package Q debacle in the first Gulf War.

378
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,402
Lieutenant Commander Kurt Frankenberger is piloting the lead

379
00:23:42,456 --> 00:23:46,062
Tomcat and immediately loses count of the number of SAM launches

380
00:23:46,126 --> 00:23:49,846
against the formation, recalling we had to trust our systems and

381
00:23:49,868 --> 00:23:53,090
visually confirm that each missile did not appear to be tracking,

382
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,960
then disregard it and evaluate the next one.

383
00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:00,374
Four F 16 wild weasels are covering the strike formation and

384
00:24:00,412 --> 00:24:03,946
launch their arms from behind them, knocking out enemy SAMs when they

385
00:24:03,968 --> 00:24:06,570
dare to illuminate their fire control radars.

386
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:11,878
The enemy fire intensifies as the Tomcats and Hornets draw closer

387
00:24:11,894 --> 00:24:15,786
to the radio transmitter. However, the radio intercept officer

388
00:24:15,818 --> 00:24:19,834
in the other F 14 is unbothered by the heavy AA fire and is filming

389
00:24:19,882 --> 00:24:22,430
the entire bombing run with a home camcorder.

390
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:26,878
Frankenberger remembers he took some great video footage

391
00:24:26,974 --> 00:24:30,610
documenting the target ingress as if he was going to Disneyland.

392
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:35,026
Once they reach the release point, the Hornets and Tomcats release their

393
00:24:35,048 --> 00:24:38,674
J dams and turn to leave the area. The radio

394
00:24:38,722 --> 00:24:42,498
transmitter is destroyed and Frankenberger and three others will be awarded

395
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:45,590
the Distinguished Flying Cross for their excellent performance.

396
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:50,214
This is also the first time an F 14 Tomcat has dropped a JDam

397
00:24:50,262 --> 00:24:53,798
in combat. One section

398
00:24:53,814 --> 00:24:56,986
of F 14 DS from VF Two is diving in on

399
00:24:57,008 --> 00:25:01,230
the heavily defended Al Takadum Air Base to the west of Baghdad.

400
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:05,530
The TomCats drop five JDAMs, which crater the runway,

401
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:08,190
making the base inoperable to the enemy.

402
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:12,782
Two more of the F two F 14s are tasked with providing air cover

403
00:25:12,836 --> 00:25:16,146
for the other Tomcats, but the Iraqi Air Force continues to

404
00:25:16,168 --> 00:25:19,842
remain on the ground. The bombing continues throughout the night

405
00:25:19,896 --> 00:25:24,642
and into the early morning hours of the 22 March 4

406
00:25:24,696 --> 00:25:27,794
FA 18 C's and two F 14s from the USS

407
00:25:27,842 --> 00:25:32,150
Abraham Lincoln strike a missile production facility in Kabala.

408
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:36,182
The ToMCAts dive in fast, releasing four 2000

409
00:25:36,236 --> 00:25:40,182
pound JDAMs. Three minutes later, the Hornets follow

410
00:25:40,236 --> 00:25:43,558
and drop a mix of JDAMs and Mark 84 bombs.

411
00:25:43,734 --> 00:25:47,418
The Iraqis launch several SAMs at the aircraft, but none track

412
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,750
and they make it back to the Abraham Lincoln without further incident.

413
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:55,246
Two wings of Tornadoes from RAF twelve Squadron are

414
00:25:55,268 --> 00:25:57,950
heading straight into the teeth of the Supermez.

415
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:02,346
The first wing of eight Tornadoes smash Iraqi radar sites

416
00:26:02,378 --> 00:26:05,986
near the northern city of Mosul with their alarm missiles, losing no

417
00:26:06,008 --> 00:26:09,746
aircraft in the process. The second wing of

418
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:13,410
seven Tornadoes is commanded by Squadron Leader Kev Rumans.

419
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:17,714
Their task is to destroy the Republican Guard barracks in the heavily

420
00:26:17,762 --> 00:26:21,286
defended town at Sarabadi, 30 miles southwest of

421
00:26:21,308 --> 00:26:25,474
Baghdad, to minimize exposure to Iraqi antiaircraft

422
00:26:25,522 --> 00:26:29,298
systems. Rumans lead the Tornadoes in line abreast so they

423
00:26:29,324 --> 00:26:33,210
can each fire two alarm missiles once enemy SAM radars light up

424
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,858
while simultaneously dropping Paveway two laser guided bombs on the

425
00:26:36,864 --> 00:26:40,710
barracks. With the sun starting to appear on the horizon,

426
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:44,446
the Tornadoes launch their alarms while unleashing all 21 of their

427
00:26:44,468 --> 00:26:47,470
paveways on the target within a two second window.

428
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:51,982
With so many missiles and bombs in the air, rumors later says,

429
00:26:52,116 --> 00:26:55,646
I remember thinking to myself that it looked like a scene out of the movie

430
00:26:55,678 --> 00:26:59,346
Armageddon. The Tornadoes beat a hasty retreat to

431
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:02,898
avoid SAM launches, but satellite imagery later confirms the

432
00:27:02,904 --> 00:27:07,270
Paveways have scored 21 direct hits on the Republican Guard barracks.

433
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:11,894
With the sun now rising over Baghdad, the first night of a Day is

434
00:27:11,932 --> 00:27:15,990
over and the remaining strike aircraft egress back to their bases.

435
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:21,186
They are soon replaced by Hornets and a ten Warthogs, along with US Marine

436
00:27:21,218 --> 00:27:24,618
and RAF Harriers, which arrive to provide close air support for

437
00:27:24,624 --> 00:27:27,610
the ground forces advancing further into Iraq.

438
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:32,686
Much like its predecessor twelve years earlier, the first night of the

439
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:36,426
air war over Iraq is a success in some respects.

440
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:39,754
It is an operational improvement as no coalition aircraft

441
00:27:39,802 --> 00:27:43,854
are shot down. This is mostly due to weaker than expected

442
00:27:43,902 --> 00:27:46,958
Iraqi resistance. Furthermore,

443
00:27:47,054 --> 00:27:50,626
major Iraqi airfields are rendered unusable by JDAM and

444
00:27:50,648 --> 00:27:54,162
Storm shadow strikes, knocking the Iraqi Air Force out of the war

445
00:27:54,216 --> 00:27:57,934
in the first few hours. In contrast to the Desert Storm

446
00:27:57,982 --> 00:28:01,446
air War, the Iraqi Air Force does not take to the skies during the

447
00:28:01,468 --> 00:28:05,058
entire campaign. When asked by the press why the Iraqi

448
00:28:05,074 --> 00:28:08,642
Air Force will not come out to fight, General Mosley responds,

449
00:28:08,786 --> 00:28:12,854
I believe that he has not flown because in their mind they've made a calculation

450
00:28:12,902 --> 00:28:17,126
that they will not survive for the rest of Operation Iraqi

451
00:28:17,158 --> 00:28:20,586
Freedom. The main focus of the coalition's air power will be to

452
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:24,590
provide close air support to ground troops as they advance northwest,

453
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:28,666
Michael Knights, a British defense analyst, will later observe.

454
00:28:28,778 --> 00:28:32,666
In contrast to the beginning of Operation Desert Storm, which had been a triumph

455
00:28:32,698 --> 00:28:36,606
of orchestration, the opening of Operation Iraqi Freedom would prove

456
00:28:36,638 --> 00:28:38,770
to be a triumph of improvisation.

457
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,914
Despite radical changes made to the plan in the hours before the

458
00:28:42,952 --> 00:28:46,930
attack, the air offensive smashes Iraqi defenses to bits.

459
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:50,706
A day is such a complete success in neutralizing enemy

460
00:28:50,738 --> 00:28:54,166
air defenses that the non stealth B One B bombers are able

461
00:28:54,188 --> 00:28:57,786
to fly daytime missions over the Supermez. By the third day of

462
00:28:57,808 --> 00:29:01,546
the campaign, the Coalition ground forces will

463
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:05,370
enjoy unrivaled air superiority as they advance northwest.

464
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,494
However, the air campaign does not deliver a strategic knockout blow

465
00:29:09,542 --> 00:29:13,386
as hoped. The decision to remove key regime targets

466
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:17,550
from the list at the last minute spares much of Saddam's military capability.

467
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:21,550
Unlike Desert Storm. His forces will continue to fight hard

468
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,870
against the advancing coalition forces.
