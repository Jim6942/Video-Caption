00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,786
This is the Hilde. It was the Dutch currency for hundreds

3
00:00:07,818 --> 00:00:10,670
of years. Then it disappeared.

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:18,074
This was a shame. Not the euro, but the death

5
00:00:18,122 --> 00:00:21,834
of the design. Its colors outdid every dollar.

6
00:00:21,962 --> 00:00:25,938
Its lighthouse stood above all buildings and its port. Schwitz embarrassed

7
00:00:25,954 --> 00:00:29,714
the queen. Some say even killed her. The Hilda

8
00:00:29,762 --> 00:00:33,078
changed the face of cash forever. I believe it's the

9
00:00:33,084 --> 00:00:36,278
best paper money ever made. But why?

10
00:00:36,444 --> 00:00:40,650
Why was Dutch money so different? Why does it look so strange?

11
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,770
Nostates who are ASIC member yet to see them? Phoenix,

12
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,950
Ocha, Oksanar was different. He designed government

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,162
issued stamps with dramatic, playful colors.

14
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:58,778
Then he used brand new techniques, like computer generated graphics,

15
00:00:58,874 --> 00:01:02,814
to create complicated geometrical patterns. In the 60s,

16
00:01:02,852 --> 00:01:06,590
he made the air flatters, a series of five portrait banknotes

17
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,270
from the Vondel, a writer, huls, a painter, sveling,

18
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,346
a composer, the router, a naval commander, and,

19
00:01:13,368 --> 00:01:17,106
of course, Spinoza. Together they all look kind

20
00:01:17,128 --> 00:01:20,566
of OD. Oksenar's faces look more like they belong in

21
00:01:20,588 --> 00:01:24,306
a comic than on a banknote. Dutch notes are very distinctive.

22
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:28,146
They are unlike any other central bank's notes that I'm

23
00:01:28,178 --> 00:01:32,246
aware of. Visually very striking. But I can imagine that not everybody likes

24
00:01:32,278 --> 00:01:35,706
them. When you think of money, you think of value.

25
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:39,114
A medium for you to exchange one thing for another.

26
00:01:39,312 --> 00:01:42,974
But money is also branding. There are millions of

27
00:01:43,012 --> 00:01:46,080
tiny billboards spread across an entire country.

28
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:50,526
It's a place where a nation shows what it stands for, a canvas to

29
00:01:50,548 --> 00:01:54,094
display national heroes and icons. So why do

30
00:01:54,132 --> 00:01:57,618
Uxenars feel like he's making a joke? The notes had to

31
00:01:57,624 --> 00:02:01,438
have portraits on them of famous historical figures,

32
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,722
which would not create any political problems. Portraits are the most used

33
00:02:04,776 --> 00:02:07,826
images on currency, and they can be a bit touchy.

34
00:02:08,018 --> 00:02:11,590
For some, a nation is nothing more than the sum of its people.

35
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,350
We use portraits to hold some up as lessons and inspiration.

36
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,210
For others, though, portraits can lift up people whose value

37
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,350
system is out of date. Maybe even threatening statues,

38
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,826
intentional or not, can be monuments, colonizers, slave owners and

39
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:30,766
authoritarians. Maybe the same could be said of the faces we put on

40
00:02:30,788 --> 00:02:34,842
currency. Should Andrew Jackson, a president and also slave owner,

41
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:38,170
be replaced by Harriet Tubman, a slave emancipator?

42
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,590
Should we avoid figures entirely?

43
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,642
The genius of Uxenar's designs is that it didn't matter.

44
00:02:44,776 --> 00:02:48,014
He neither avoided people entirely or kept

45
00:02:48,062 --> 00:02:51,534
them. He caricatured them. This is George

46
00:02:51,582 --> 00:02:54,260
Washington. Fuck yeah, President.

47
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:59,606
And this is mean.

48
00:02:59,788 --> 00:03:03,746
Okay? If you live in a country whose banknotes

49
00:03:03,778 --> 00:03:07,502
scream, take me seriously, keeping or removing a portrait

50
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:11,286
will always be a controversy. If you have banknotes

51
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:15,082
that play the fool, well, then there's not much of a throne to fight

52
00:03:15,136 --> 00:03:19,110
over. The air flatters

53
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:23,066
changed portrait currency, but it's Oxenar's second series that turned

54
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:27,054
it on its head. He was asked to replace the 100 hilda and

55
00:03:27,092 --> 00:03:29,710
add a 50 and 250 banknote.

56
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,066
For the 100, he replaces the naval commander not with

57
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:37,682
someone else, but with a bird. This was

58
00:03:37,736 --> 00:03:41,774
crazy. A snipe doesn't have ties to citizenship.

59
00:03:41,902 --> 00:03:45,698
It's a bird found in marshy land. That happens to be in the Netherlands,

60
00:03:45,794 --> 00:03:49,826
but it is by no means the Netherlands. For hundreds

61
00:03:49,858 --> 00:03:53,170
of years, money was intimately tied to the faces of rulers,

62
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,346
earth changing scientists, and artists. Ulksenar played

63
00:03:57,378 --> 00:04:00,534
a joke on them all. He made the Holnit Hilda,

64
00:04:00,582 --> 00:04:03,706
the first banknote in the Western world to no longer be a

65
00:04:03,728 --> 00:04:06,410
portrait, just a bird.

66
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,714
With the 50 Hilda banknote, he changed it up again.

67
00:04:10,912 --> 00:04:14,446
He proposes a sunflower, another object with

68
00:04:14,468 --> 00:04:18,126
no clear ties to a nation, but still an indirect homage to

69
00:04:18,148 --> 00:04:21,438
Vancouch. The glue had made the bee fall off from the

70
00:04:21,444 --> 00:04:24,818
top onto the flower, as though it flew there.

71
00:04:24,904 --> 00:04:28,670
The 50 mark is horizontal. Some of its text is vertical.

72
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,510
This tempts the owner to turn the bill around. You hand the cashier

73
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,086
not money, but a flower. Finally,

74
00:04:36,188 --> 00:04:39,494
there's the lighthouse, Olksanar's last and probably most

75
00:04:39,532 --> 00:04:43,394

92
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,370
Oksanar wanted to make currency that symbolized the Netherlands

93
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,746
without being a cliche. No windmills, clogs,

94
00:05:54,778 --> 00:05:58,094
cows, or tulips. Instead of projecting what the Dutch are

95
00:05:58,132 --> 00:06:02,586
loudly, Okseenar intentionally chose symbols that were a bit more normal.

96
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:06,786
He then took it a step further by converting these symbols into security

97
00:06:06,888 --> 00:06:10,722
features. Banknotes need to be secured against

98
00:06:10,776 --> 00:06:14,398
forgery. That's why banks will issue paper money with watermarks,

99
00:06:14,494 --> 00:06:17,814
so the bills are harder to copy. Oksanar also

100
00:06:17,852 --> 00:06:21,606
designed watermarks, but they were different. Instead of

101
00:06:21,628 --> 00:06:25,206
heads or angels, Oksanar chose animals for

102
00:06:25,228 --> 00:06:28,454
the 100. The watermark is the head of a snipe.

103
00:06:28,582 --> 00:06:32,230
On the flower it's a bee, and on the lighthouse,

104
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:47,722
a dune. Rabbit and

105
00:06:47,776 --> 00:06:51,294
Donkey ginjette, Lichter and Donker don

106
00:06:51,332 --> 00:06:55,538
the rest. On a papill. You can look through the note and you see

107
00:06:55,704 --> 00:06:59,518
a watermark. That is a rabbit. It was a rabbit belonging

108
00:06:59,534 --> 00:07:03,166
to my girlfriend. Everybody has to walk around with my rabbit

109
00:07:03,198 --> 00:07:06,898
in their pocket. I like that. Kaki is long as yet in a

Lift out downward and aim complete plighty on the ten

114
00:07:21,436 --> 00:07:25,034
Hilde bill and on the Spinoza are fingerprints. I put

115
00:07:25,072 --> 00:07:28,234
something personal into this. My fingerprint in the hair of one of the world's most

116
00:07:28,272 --> 00:07:32,326
important philosophers. Spinoza. Very unholy of me.

117
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:35,774
Not very nice. The smudge of a finger is so sloppy that

118
00:07:35,812 --> 00:07:38,926
no serious artist would dare to include it.

119
00:07:39,108 --> 00:07:42,238
Uxenar did it anyway. By the time that the

120
00:07:42,244 --> 00:07:46,174
Dutch National bank realized what they were, it was too late.

121
00:07:46,302 --> 00:07:49,762
A joke in the pockets of an entire population. That is the nice

122
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:53,950
part of making banknotes. You can make monuments by the millions.

123
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:57,074
He did the same for the lighthouse. In the beacon,

124
00:07:57,122 --> 00:08:00,050
he hid three women's names, his granddaughter,

125
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:03,446
girlfriend, and friend. The engraver had

126
00:08:03,468 --> 00:08:06,886
included these names, also completely unknown to the

127
00:08:06,908 --> 00:08:11,234
Dutch National Bank. The combination of security features

128
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:14,390
and Oksenar's personal humor was a reoccurring theme.

129
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,946
The smallest lettering that you see in that white square, well, this is meant so

130
00:08:17,968 --> 00:08:21,306
that when you are sitting somewhere in a private place, like the toilet or somewhere

131
00:08:21,338 --> 00:08:24,810
like that, you have something to read. Another counterfeiting technique

132
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:28,346
is microprinting. Banks will put tiny design printed

133
00:08:28,378 --> 00:08:31,854
features onto a banknote. This makes it difficult for

134
00:08:31,892 --> 00:08:35,706
counterfeiters to reprint it accurately with a standard photocopying

135
00:08:35,738 --> 00:08:39,410
machine. This can be done by printing small lines of text,

136
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,914
but that's kind of boring. It's a security feature that's just

137
00:08:42,952 --> 00:08:46,318
kind of slapped on to the design. The artist comes along, hands over

138
00:08:46,344 --> 00:08:49,750
his sketches, his ideas. And then they tell him the design

139
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,334
had to be changed. That's our job. We are responsible for security.

140
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:57,430
This is to regarding.

141
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:08,742
It's one way of doing it, treating a banknote design and its security feature

142
00:09:08,806 --> 00:09:12,590
as separate jobs. But there is also another way.

143
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,590
You make the security features an integral part of the design.

144
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,262
I said, I have to have unrestricted access to every

145
00:09:21,316 --> 00:09:24,718
detail, to every technique, to every secret. Otherwise I cannot make a

146
00:09:24,724 --> 00:09:28,042
good design. I must know what the techniques are. The bank accepted this.

147
00:09:28,116 --> 00:09:31,406
You can add a bunch of small thin lines because it makes the banknote

148
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:34,670
secure, or you can add a bunch of small thin lines

149
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,078
because it's necessary for it to look good.

and adjusting to different areas in a grid.

00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,006
When I made my first banknote, the printers maintained that more color was

170
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:06,386
an impossibility. They said when you use a green, it must be very dark and

171
00:11:06,408 --> 00:11:09,726
blackish green. Otherwise it's not safe. I discovered

172
00:11:09,758 --> 00:11:13,026
that this was not true. I just had to keep on asking and asking.

173
00:11:13,128 --> 00:11:16,734
Oksanar's banknotes did not only stand out next to single colored banknotes,

174
00:11:16,782 --> 00:11:19,862
but they also stood out among the colored ones. It's almost

175
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:23,174
as though Oksinar's banknotes were like monopoly money,

176
00:11:23,372 --> 00:11:26,918
which is, well, exactly what they were. The only money I

177
00:11:26,924 --> 00:11:30,262
had seen, which was as clear as I wanted money to be, was monopoly money.

178
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:33,434
That was nice money in my eyes, so I hope that

179
00:11:33,472 --> 00:11:36,266
my own work looks a little bit like that. You don't need to look at

180
00:11:36,288 --> 00:11:39,500
the number on monopoly money to recognize its value.

181
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:44,378
The design is clear, the layout standardized, and the topography loud.

182
00:11:44,554 --> 00:11:48,490
With the hilde, it was the same. At a moment's notice,

183
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:52,414
the faintest glimpse you could identify exactly which banknote it

184
00:11:52,452 --> 00:11:55,714
was. The specific colors that were chosen were

185
00:11:55,752 --> 00:11:59,902
almost nearly perfect. The primary colors, blue, red, and yellow,

186
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:04,078
are the most visually clear for the human eye. Oksinar believed

187
00:12:04,094 --> 00:12:07,640
the notes which were used the most should also reflect that

188
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,954
when the value of the money was higher, only then would you find the secondary

189
00:12:12,002 --> 00:12:15,350
colors a dignified green or a royal violet.

190
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:19,014
If you were colorblind, you're probably not getting this video,

191
00:12:19,132 --> 00:12:22,330
but you could also still determine the Hilda's value from large,

192
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,882
legible letters. The objective was to use very

193
00:12:25,936 --> 00:12:29,546
clear typography so that when you folded up the note you could see what

194
00:12:29,568 --> 00:12:32,234
the value of the banknote was at least four times.

195
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:35,770
Uchsenar's designs were influential for the euro.

196
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:39,786
They didn't consider using separate colors until the Dutch National bank submitted

197
00:12:39,818 --> 00:12:43,882
a proposal based on his designs. He changed the rules

198
00:12:43,946 --> 00:12:47,406
for what a banknote could and should look like it

199
00:12:47,428 --> 00:12:51,246
is. The deep in Nadalando's arms break as she

200
00:12:51,268 --> 00:12:55,746
flagged by the Kustwantestitson Merkering spun and Valerien

201
00:12:55,778 --> 00:12:59,474
Spoon to survive and Landhill

202
00:12:59,522 --> 00:13:02,918
moi symbolis and Hill had Ken by a

203
00:13:02,924 --> 00:13:05,730
