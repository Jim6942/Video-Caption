1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,546
See this? This is what dropshipping gurus

2
00:00:03,578 --> 00:00:07,262
like to call a winning product. A hundred thousand dollars in sales

3
00:00:07,316 --> 00:00:11,038
in one month, and almost $200,000 in total. I'm going to

4
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:13,694
show you how I did it so you can do it as well. So pay

5
00:00:13,732 --> 00:00:17,038
attention. What is this product and how did I find it? I don't know if

6
00:00:17,044 --> 00:00:20,842
I can say it on YouTube, but it's a roller for your Zar,

7
00:00:20,906 --> 00:00:24,522
your cheese, your grass, your dunk,

8
00:00:24,586 --> 00:00:28,166
your Wakita back. And the way

9
00:00:28,188 --> 00:00:31,298
I found it was with my TikTok Banner account. For those of you who don't

10
00:00:31,314 --> 00:00:34,806
know, you can force TikTok to literally show you whatever you want. So what

11
00:00:34,828 --> 00:00:38,374
I did was I made a new TikTok account and I only searched for

12
00:00:38,412 --> 00:00:41,386
dropshipping products. So now, anytime I go on that account,

13
00:00:41,568 --> 00:00:44,714
all I see is dropshipping products.

14
00:00:44,832 --> 00:00:48,186
And at the beginning of this year, this account called copper roller was

15
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:51,162
blowing up. If you had a banner account, you would have seen that product.

16
00:00:51,216 --> 00:00:54,714
But for some reason, there weren't that many accounts running it. So I looked

17
00:00:54,752 --> 00:00:57,758
into it and I found out why at the time, if you search for it

18
00:00:57,764 --> 00:01:01,418
on Aliexpress, you wouldn't be able to find it. And if you are a beginner

19
00:01:01,514 --> 00:01:04,414
at that point, you give up because you think there's no way you can actually

20
00:01:04,452 --> 00:01:08,302
source it. So because of that, and. Cause it was too controversial,

21
00:01:08,366 --> 00:01:12,082
like, I didn't test it, but like, three months later, my winning products

22
00:01:12,136 --> 00:01:15,314
were starting to die out and I was getting desperate. And I also found

23
00:01:15,352 --> 00:01:18,934
out that you can just give your supplier an Alibaba link, or even the

24
00:01:18,972 --> 00:01:22,386
TikTok video link, and they might be able to source the product. So I ordered

25
00:01:22,418 --> 00:01:25,750
it and I made two new TikTok accounts. Zawheel.

26
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,054
This is a UK account. It has a UK SIM in it and

27
00:01:30,092 --> 00:01:32,938
the Zarwheel Co. This is a US account.

28
00:01:33,104 --> 00:01:36,890
And for the first four videos, I literally just copied the copper roller guys

29
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,442
videos, filmed twice edited, twice posted on both

30
00:01:40,496 --> 00:01:43,962
phones. And the videos were already starting to show potential, like 40K

31
00:01:44,016 --> 00:01:47,678
views, 40K views, 20K views. But nothing was going viral. So in

32
00:01:47,684 --> 00:01:50,686
that case, usually what I do is try and add a slight twist to the

33
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:54,522
video. So I use my banner account to make a fake

34
00:01:54,586 --> 00:01:58,066
comment. That ain't no broccoli roller. So the whole angle was that

35
00:01:58,088 --> 00:02:01,842
I was using broccoli and cheese to hint what the product was actually for

36
00:02:01,896 --> 00:02:05,426
without actually saying it. And you know how there's always that one person that just

37
00:02:05,448 --> 00:02:08,866
ruins the surprise and admits what it is? Yeah. So I was trying

38
00:02:08,888 --> 00:02:12,086
to play off that and spark some emotion. And this is

39
00:02:12,108 --> 00:02:15,762
what I came up with. You people, if this video gets demonetized, it's your fault.

40
00:02:15,826 --> 00:02:19,514
You'll see. That ain't no broccoli roller. Sir, I have no

41
00:02:19,552 --> 00:02:23,014
idea what you're talking about. This device is strictly for cooking

42
00:02:23,062 --> 00:02:26,810
broccoli rolls in the oven. There is literally no other purpose.

43
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,442
So anyways, I made a few of those videos, and the third one started

44
00:02:32,496 --> 00:02:35,694
picking up on the US account. It went from forty K to fifty K

45
00:02:35,732 --> 00:02:39,086
to seventy K to one hundred to two hundred K. And at that

46
00:02:39,108 --> 00:02:42,430
point, I was at 300 followers. I already made the Shopify website.

47
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,598
So I just typed my website link in the description.

48
00:02:45,694 --> 00:02:49,762
This was June 23, and from 200K

49
00:02:49,816 --> 00:02:53,554
views, I got almost $500 in sales. That's just from

50
00:02:53,592 --> 00:02:57,262
people going out of their way and typing the website link in their browser,

51
00:02:57,326 --> 00:03:00,446
not even just clicking a link. And the next day, just before the video hit

52
00:03:00,488 --> 00:03:04,006
1 million views, I reached 1000 followers. So I was able to put my

53
00:03:04,028 --> 00:03:07,366
link in there. And that day, I got three K in sales.

54
00:03:07,468 --> 00:03:12,298
This one video got to 3.6 million views and it brought $18,000

55
00:03:12,384 --> 00:03:15,802
in sales. That is crazy. Usually I get like

56
00:03:15,856 --> 00:03:19,786
one to two K in sales per million views. This is what happens when

57
00:03:19,808 --> 00:03:22,910
you have a product that is super controversial and that people

58
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,006
really want. It goes viral quick, and the sales are just crazy.

59
00:03:27,108 --> 00:03:30,462
But it also comes with plenty problems. The first problem,

60
00:03:30,596 --> 00:03:33,934
community guideline strike. Yeah, you can't promote these videos

61
00:03:33,972 --> 00:03:37,346
on TikTok. So they took down the video, and on the 27th, you can see

62
00:03:37,368 --> 00:03:40,690
the sales dropped like crazy. The second problem,

63
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,094
account ban. See this TikTok is wicked.

64
00:03:44,142 --> 00:03:47,406
They'll wait for you to start to see some small success, and then they'll

65
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:50,726
just start banning, banning, banning, banning, banning all your videos one by one by

66
00:03:50,748 --> 00:03:54,246
one. And I think after about seven or eight banned videos, they will just

67
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:57,698
shut down the entire account. And that's what happened to the US account. And that's

68
00:03:57,714 --> 00:04:01,274
why I'm showing you screenshots for it. But the UK account is still there.

69
00:04:01,312 --> 00:04:04,730
So anyways, that was June. This was the first week

70
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,914
in July. What happened here,

71
00:04:07,952 --> 00:04:11,434
Mikey? How did you do that? Well, let me

72
00:04:11,472 --> 00:04:15,642
tell you. Look, you guys, you don't listen. I keep telling you, Instagram Reels

73
00:04:15,786 --> 00:04:19,246
reupload your TikToks to Instagram Reels. I know a lot of

74
00:04:19,268 --> 00:04:22,206
you guys have this problem where you try to make a new Instagram account and

75
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:25,770
you instantly get banned. I think I might have a solution.

76
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:29,726
It's not properly tested, but I tried it on two iPhones and two Androids

77
00:04:29,758 --> 00:04:33,266
and it worked. So you guys can try it. So log out of all your

78
00:04:33,288 --> 00:04:36,718
Instagram accounts except one. That one account should have some

79
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:40,694
views on it already. Then on the login page, go to the settings and

80
00:04:40,732 --> 00:04:43,766
delete every account except that one. Then go

81
00:04:43,788 --> 00:04:47,042
to your phone settings, general storage, Instagram,

82
00:04:47,106 --> 00:04:50,478
then offload app, then delete app. It's the same for Android.

83
00:04:50,514 --> 00:04:53,994
Just clear the cache and delete the app. Then reinstall it and

84
00:04:54,032 --> 00:04:57,546
make a new account. But choose the complete sign up option.

85
00:04:57,648 --> 00:05:00,378
Then add a profile picture, share as post,

86
00:05:00,464 --> 00:05:03,902
and that's it. Please don't come for me if it doesn't work, but still

87
00:05:03,956 --> 00:05:07,102
try it. It should work. So as I was saying,

88
00:05:07,236 --> 00:05:10,570
Instagram Reels look eigth July.

89
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:14,274
33 million views. Seven K

90
00:05:14,312 --> 00:05:16,802
in a day. 20K in a day.

91
00:05:16,936 --> 00:05:21,202
14K in a day. Ten K in a day. Shopify payment

92
00:05:21,256 --> 00:05:25,166
hold in a day. So Shopify held my funds

93
00:05:25,198 --> 00:05:28,154
and put it under review, not because the product was controversial,

94
00:05:28,222 --> 00:05:31,958
but because the sales came so quickly. So it was just like a standard review.

95
00:05:32,044 --> 00:05:35,730
But the thing is, the product could have been considered paraphernalia

96
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:39,266
on Shopify payments, which is not allowed. So I asked my mentor,

97
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:42,774
Michael Benstein about it, and he was actually concerned. And if you know Michael,

98
00:05:42,822 --> 00:05:46,438
you know he's never worried about anything ever. So the fact that he was telling

99
00:05:46,454 --> 00:05:50,246
me to actually take it seriously, it puts me on higher list. Because apparently

100
00:05:50,278 --> 00:05:53,994
if one big payment processor bans you, you can be blacklisted

101
00:05:54,042 --> 00:05:57,402
from all the other major processors. PayPal, Shopify,

102
00:05:57,466 --> 00:06:00,842
stripe, all of them for like five years. It's not a joke.

103
00:06:00,906 --> 00:06:05,098
So if you are running these kind of controversial products, don't use Shopify payments

104
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:08,818
or PayPal or any of the major ones. Check if they allow this stuff.

105
00:06:08,904 --> 00:06:12,626
Me, I immediately turned off PayPAl because I didn't want any problems. But I

106
00:06:12,648 --> 00:06:16,354
had to keep Shopify payments on because I didn't have any other alternative. So for

107
00:06:16,392 --> 00:06:19,666
almost like two weeks, I was going back and forth, back and forth

108
00:06:19,698 --> 00:06:23,154
with every single high risk payment processor that exists

109
00:06:23,202 --> 00:06:26,486
in this world. Most of them didn't even reply. Most of them disqualified me

110
00:06:26,508 --> 00:06:30,262
because I don't have a US business. I wasn't getting anyone to take me on

111
00:06:30,316 --> 00:06:34,102
until my friend recommended me. This one called we transact.

112
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:37,254
They saved my life. But the catch is that because it's high risk,

113
00:06:37,302 --> 00:06:40,442
they take 10% of the sales and hold it for

114
00:06:40,496 --> 00:06:43,814
six months just in case you decide to do some shady stuff and not fulfill

115
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:47,054
the orders or something, but it's fine. I'd rather that than to be

116
00:06:47,092 --> 00:06:50,666
banned from Shopify. Shopify. Please, I beg you. It's for broccoli and cheese.

117
00:06:50,698 --> 00:06:54,026
Also, this is not sponsored by Wetransact by the way. So anyways,

118
00:06:54,058 --> 00:06:57,342
now I found my new winning products, so now it was time to scale.

119
00:06:57,406 --> 00:07:01,122
And usually what I do is just make new accounts and just post more,

120
00:07:01,176 --> 00:07:04,482
post more volume, volume, volume. But for I don't even know how long.

121
00:07:04,536 --> 00:07:08,062
Michael just kept telling me, telling me to hire people to film

122
00:07:08,126 --> 00:07:11,174
for me instead of me doing all the work. If I would be a one

123
00:07:11,212 --> 00:07:14,806
man show, I wouldn't be able to sleep at night. I see how

124
00:07:14,828 --> 00:07:18,534
much money you will lose by not having another person in your team. You have

125
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:22,026
no clue how much money you're leaving on the table. If you

126
00:07:22,048 --> 00:07:25,130
double the output, you're going to get double the resUlt.

127
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,906
So if you have a person who replicates what you're doing, you're going to make

128
00:07:29,008 --> 00:07:32,278
double the money. This guy is trying to make me spend the money that I've

129
00:07:32,294 --> 00:07:35,798
suffered to end. Anyways, so I mentioned I was hiring in one of

130
00:07:35,824 --> 00:07:39,438
my previous videos and some of you guys signed up and I started working with

131
00:07:39,444 --> 00:07:42,282
like three or four of you. So now, on top of me posting TikToks,

132
00:07:42,346 --> 00:07:45,534
the plan was to manage creators. Every day I had to give them

133
00:07:45,572 --> 00:07:49,394
two video ideas for them to film, edit and upload. And I was paying each

134
00:07:49,432 --> 00:07:52,978
person $1,200 a month, so I had to

135
00:07:52,984 --> 00:07:56,370
make it work. But for almost an entire month, like nothing was working.

136
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,158
A couple of the creators crossed 100K view videos, but none

137
00:08:00,174 --> 00:08:03,446
of them really went viral. So now, at this point, I lost money on that

138
00:08:03,468 --> 00:08:06,534
investment. But obviously they weren't the problem because they were just doing

139
00:08:06,572 --> 00:08:09,750
what I told them to do and I was just making them copy my old

140
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,178
video ideas over and over and over again. I wasn't really doing anything

141
00:08:13,264 --> 00:08:16,682
different, but one day I remembered this video that I saw a while

142
00:08:16,736 --> 00:08:20,458
ago on TikTok. This is the sapax. Just remember, it's only intended to

143
00:08:20,464 --> 00:08:23,546
be used for aromatherapy. First, I find a pine cone with

144
00:08:23,568 --> 00:08:26,446
a lot of sap on it. I scoop the sap off the scale of the

145
00:08:26,468 --> 00:08:29,866
pine cone and scrape it into my glass jar. I keep scooping

146
00:08:29,898 --> 00:08:33,726
and scraping until my jar is filled with sticky, icky sap. Then I

147
00:08:33,748 --> 00:08:37,102
drill a half inch hole into this stump that I like to meditate at.

148
00:08:37,156 --> 00:08:40,546
I take this glass sculpture I got from a sculpture store and put

149
00:08:40,568 --> 00:08:43,694
it in the hole. I take a big old scoop of sap with the sap

150
00:08:43,742 --> 00:08:47,246
axe and then set it aside for later. Using my creme brulee torch,

151
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:51,074
I heat up the glass sculpture. I ready the axe while the glass cools

152
00:08:51,122 --> 00:08:54,658
and then dab the sap into the middle of the glass sculpture.

153
00:08:54,754 --> 00:08:58,754
I waft the incense over my face and give thanks. I set the sap

154
00:08:58,802 --> 00:09:02,218
axe aside, contemplate life, and prepare to repeat the process.

155
00:09:02,384 --> 00:09:06,042
This has over 14 million views. When you see a video like this,

156
00:09:06,096 --> 00:09:09,414
you really need to pay attention to understand why it went viral.

157
00:09:09,462 --> 00:09:12,890
Obviously, he was doing the same thing I was doing by pretending it was something

158
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,846
else. So his video didn't get taken down. But the whole vibe of

159
00:09:16,868 --> 00:09:20,206
the video was just different. The pacing was slower, so it kind of

160
00:09:20,228 --> 00:09:23,678
got pushed to an older audience. The background was just beautiful.

161
00:09:23,844 --> 00:09:27,114
His voice was calming, nature sounds, blah, blah, blah.

162
00:09:27,162 --> 00:09:30,594
I don't fully understand it, but like watching the video, you can just feel the

163
00:09:30,632 --> 00:09:34,258
vibe. So I tried to replicate it as closely as I could. I found a

164
00:09:34,264 --> 00:09:37,762
relaxing voice on play Ht. I filmed near some

165
00:09:37,816 --> 00:09:41,846
lake near my area. I slowed down the pacing and I ended up with

166
00:09:41,868 --> 00:09:45,414
this video. This is the zaw wheel. Just remember, it's only

167
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:48,738
intended to be used for cooking. First I take my

168
00:09:48,764 --> 00:09:52,090
mozzarella and carefully place it into the zaw wheel.

169
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,766
Now I close it and twist so it packs the sticky,

170
00:09:55,798 --> 00:09:59,180
icky cheese evenly. Then I add some baking paper

171
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,230
and twist again until it disappears into the zaw wheel.

172
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,498
Now I can enjoy my tasty mozzarella sticks.

173
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:11,038
You see how the vibes are kind of similar? I don't know

174
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:14,366
how to explain it, but you get what I'm trying to say. This video of

175
00:10:14,388 --> 00:10:18,066
mine got 2.2 million views. And that's where the second spike in sales came

176
00:10:18,088 --> 00:10:21,234
from. At the end of July with a ten K day. And because of that,

177
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:24,162
I ended up doing my 1st 100K month. Crazy,

178
00:10:24,296 --> 00:10:27,694
crazy. So now all I had to do was just get the creators

179
00:10:27,742 --> 00:10:31,014
to replicate the same video. So I made each of them copy the same

180
00:10:31,052 --> 00:10:34,470
video at least five times. It didn't really go viral for the others,

181
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,714
but one of them got almost 10 million views.

182
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:41,746
And he brought this huge spike in August, which is over $30,000

183
00:10:41,788 --> 00:10:45,386
in sales. So of course we had to have a Zoom call. Yo. Hello.

184
00:10:45,568 --> 00:10:48,746
How are you doing? I'm doing good, I think you, with the

185
00:10:48,768 --> 00:10:52,026
10 million views, brought like 30K in sales. Really?

186
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:55,102
Yes. Yeah. I put like five creators on it.

187
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:58,606
I think you were the only one that made the Zawi work.

188
00:10:58,788 --> 00:11:02,158
Okay. And the funny thing is, everyone else had an iPhone and you were the

189
00:11:02,164 --> 00:11:06,058
only one that had an iPhone. Yeah. Be honest. How was

190
00:11:06,084 --> 00:11:09,474
it like working with me? Because you are one of the first

191
00:11:09,512 --> 00:11:13,202
few creators I've had. I mean, for me, it was very

192
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:16,886
easy. You told me what to do, and I just did it. You pay

193
00:11:16,988 --> 00:11:20,758
good. You're saying I'm the best.

194
00:11:20,924 --> 00:11:24,918
Who's better than you? I don't know.

195
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:28,134
How long do my videos take you? Like, in a day? In a day?

196
00:11:28,172 --> 00:11:31,770
Maybe like 2 hours. Maybe 2

197
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,274
hours? I'm done. 2 hours and you're done for the whole day.

198
00:11:35,312 --> 00:11:38,570
You don't do anything. It's bad. I was hoping that

199
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,754
it would motivate you guys because you've gotten 10

200
00:11:41,792 --> 00:11:45,966
million views. Doesn't that give you some kind of hype? You've generated 30K

201
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:49,406
in sales. You have seen that it's possible, so you

202
00:11:49,428 --> 00:11:52,906
should be on it. You do realize

203
00:11:53,018 --> 00:11:56,546
that this is why people don't make it, right? The fact

204
00:11:56,568 --> 00:12:00,242
that you're not putting in the work, you feel lazy. You feel that is

205
00:12:00,296 --> 00:12:03,826
a huge factor. It's not that it doesn't work. It's that people

206
00:12:03,928 --> 00:12:07,166
just don't try. I'll be on it. I'm telling

207
00:12:07,198 --> 00:12:10,066
you now. So, yeah, Noah made me back all the money from the creators.

208
00:12:10,098 --> 00:12:12,806
So it was definitely worth it. I'm not going to lie. It's very hard to

209
00:12:12,828 --> 00:12:16,018
manage creators. But that's the game. So, yeah, June,

210
00:12:16,114 --> 00:12:18,870
July, August, I made $176,000.

211
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,426
And before I show you the total,

212
00:12:22,528 --> 00:12:25,866
quick side note, you guys, I beg you. You guys are making me

213
00:12:25,888 --> 00:12:29,994
an enemy to the black community. I've realized that sometimes when a black person goes

214
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:33,546
viral on TikTok, some of you will just be commenting. Is this Mikey? Is this

215
00:12:33,568 --> 00:12:36,734
Mikey? Is this Mikey? Don't get me wrong, I think it'sick that you guys even

216
00:12:36,772 --> 00:12:40,302
know who I am. But when you do that, the videos get

217
00:12:40,356 --> 00:12:43,694
pushed to other dropshippers. And because of that, they don't make much money

218
00:12:43,732 --> 00:12:47,562
from their viral videos. So I beg you, please stop. Also stop replicating

219
00:12:47,626 --> 00:12:51,546
the silent basketball videos. Yes, it was me. And even if you go viral

220
00:12:51,578 --> 00:12:56,662
with those kind of videos, you won't get sales. So anyways, in total, almost $200,000

221
00:12:56,716 --> 00:13:00,306
in sales. I don't know the profit right now, but I'll put all the maths

222
00:13:00,418 --> 00:13:04,038
on the screen. Please don't just watch my videos and do nothing after.

223
00:13:04,124 --> 00:13:06,100
Go and film TikToks. Please. Good night.
