1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:04,474
In the early hours of the morning, a cutter carrying

2
00:00:04,522 --> 00:00:09,018
women and children from the wrecked Royal Navy troopship HMS Birkenhead

3
00:00:09,114 --> 00:00:13,134
is rode to safety. From a distance. They watch in

4
00:00:13,172 --> 00:00:16,414
horror as the officers and troops stand fast on

5
00:00:16,452 --> 00:00:20,286
deck, silent, at attention as the

6
00:00:20,308 --> 00:00:23,040
stricken ship rapidly sinks beneath them.

7
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,926
HMS Birkenhead is one of the first iron hulled ships built for

8
00:00:29,948 --> 00:00:33,170
the Royal Navy. It's originally designed as a steam

9
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,898
frigate, but during construction it's converted to be a troopship.

10
00:00:36,994 --> 00:00:41,046
A frigate is an agile warship commonly used as an escort

11
00:00:41,078 --> 00:00:45,126
vessel for larger convoys. The Admiralty are uncertain

12
00:00:45,158 --> 00:00:48,986
of the relatively new steam power in ships and don't want

13
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:52,798
to risk their fleet with an untested technology. As a

14
00:00:52,804 --> 00:00:56,682
troopship, it can quickly deploy troops where needed, but won't

15
00:00:56,746 --> 00:01:01,114
need to fight. The ship has twelve watertight

16
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:04,766
compartments separating the forward sections, the ship's

17
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:07,998
machinery midship and the aft compartments.

18
00:01:08,094 --> 00:01:11,506
HMS Birkenhead is designed by John led and

19
00:01:11,528 --> 00:01:15,002
built in the John led shipyard in Birkenhead, Lancashire.

20
00:01:15,086 --> 00:01:18,626
It's originally christened HMS Vulcan and launched

21
00:01:18,658 --> 00:01:22,162
by the Marchones of Westminster on 30 December

22
00:01:22,226 --> 00:01:26,290
1845. By the end of the year, it's renamed HMS

23
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,594
Birkenhead in honor of the town where it's built.

24
00:01:29,712 --> 00:01:33,302
HMS Birkenhead is 64 meters in length with a beam

25
00:01:33,366 --> 00:01:36,762
of 11 meters and a draught of 5 meters below

26
00:01:36,816 --> 00:01:40,746
the waterline. The ship's powered by two forester and CO

27
00:01:40,848 --> 00:01:44,282
564 hp steam engines driving

28
00:01:44,346 --> 00:01:47,338
a pair of paddle wheels 6 meters in diameter.

29
00:01:47,434 --> 00:01:51,322
With a top speed of ten knots, the ship has a full complement

30
00:01:51,386 --> 00:01:55,358
of sails and the steam engines provide additional maneuverability

31
00:01:55,454 --> 00:01:59,442
and speed. The ship's manned by a crew of 125

32
00:01:59,496 --> 00:02:02,814
officers and men. HMS Birkenhead

33
00:02:02,862 --> 00:02:06,238
sails its maiden voyage from Birkenhead to the Royal Navy

34
00:02:06,254 --> 00:02:10,214
Base in Plymouth, Devon, in 1846. It's in

35
00:02:10,252 --> 00:02:14,194
service for five years before it's laid up in Plymouth, where it's refitted

36
00:02:14,242 --> 00:02:17,862
before going back into service. In January 1852,

37
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:21,414
under the command of Captain Robert Salmond, HMS Birkenhead

38
00:02:21,462 --> 00:02:25,206
sails from Portsmouth bound for Algoa Bay on the east

39
00:02:25,238 --> 00:02:28,486
coast of South Africa. On board are troops belonging

40
00:02:28,518 --> 00:02:31,994
to ten different British army regiments. The troops

41
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:35,866
will reinforce British forces fighting the 8th Causa

42
00:02:35,898 --> 00:02:39,034
War against the indigenous Causa tribes of the Eastern

43
00:02:39,082 --> 00:02:42,330
Cape region of South Africa. On the 5 January,

44
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:46,318
Birkenhead calls at Queenstown in Ireland to pick up more troops,

45
00:02:46,414 --> 00:02:49,726
as well as the wives and families of several of the officers

46
00:02:49,758 --> 00:02:52,994
on board. After six weeks at sea, Birkenhead docks in

47
00:02:53,032 --> 00:02:57,190
Simonstown in False Bay on the morning of the 23 February,

48
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,334
the Royal Navy took over the harbor at Simonstown in

49
00:03:01,372 --> 00:03:05,014
the 1790s to build out a naval base which still

50
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:08,534
exists today under the South African Navy. Most of the women and

51
00:03:08,572 --> 00:03:12,154
children on board disembark together with several troops who have

52
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,782
become ill during the voyage. During their stay in Simonstown,

53
00:03:15,846 --> 00:03:19,686
nine cavalry horses, several bales of hay, and 35 tons

54
00:03:19,718 --> 00:03:23,198
of coal are taken on board in preparation for the last leg of

55
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:27,262
the voyage to Algoa Bay. This last leg is around 450

56
00:03:27,316 --> 00:03:30,350
nautical miles and will take two days to sail.

57
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,894
At 1800 on the 25 February, in clear skies and

58
00:03:36,932 --> 00:03:40,882
calm seas, Birkinhead set sail for Algoa Bay with

59
00:03:40,936 --> 00:03:44,610
between 630 and 643 men, women,

60
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,326
and children on board. The exact number isn't recorded.

61
00:03:48,508 --> 00:03:52,146
In order to make the best possible speed, Captain Salmon decides to hug

62
00:03:52,178 --> 00:03:56,018
the coastline, setting a course that will keep Birkenhead approximately

63
00:03:56,114 --> 00:03:58,070
3 miles off the coast.

64
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:06,598
On the voyage south from Plymouth, Birkenhead sailed against the Benguela

65
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:10,294
Current, sailing up the east coast of southern Africa. It faces

66
00:04:10,342 --> 00:04:13,914
the Mozambique Current. These standing ocean currents

67
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:17,230
are most powerful in deep water. Closer to land,

68
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,434
the currents encounter resistance from the land in shallower water, which slows

69
00:04:21,482 --> 00:04:25,422
them down, and so it's easier to sail against the current in shallower

70
00:04:25,486 --> 00:04:29,522
water while hugging the coastline. Just before 200

71
00:04:29,576 --> 00:04:33,122
on the 26 February, Birkenhead is making 8.5

72
00:04:33,176 --> 00:04:36,274
knots. While passing danger point off the coast of

73
00:04:36,312 --> 00:04:40,098
Hansbai, the leadsman in the bow takes a deaf sounding.

74
00:04:40,194 --> 00:04:44,070
There's 22 meters of water beneath Birkenhead's bow.

75
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,302
When sailing at night, the land might not be visible,

76
00:04:51,366 --> 00:04:55,190
and so one way to navigate is to follow a depth contour.

77
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,458
The Leedsman takes regular depth soundings by dropping a

78
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:02,254
weighted rope and counting the number of knots in the rope between the

79
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:05,934
ship and the seabed. If the depth gets shallower, they turn

80
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,050
the ship out to sea, and if the depth gets deeper,

81
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,720
they turn back to land.

82
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:17,102
Before the leadsman can make his next sounding, Birkenhead strikes

83
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:20,402
an uncharted rock 3.7 meters below

84
00:05:20,456 --> 00:05:23,918
the bough. In stormy weather, when waves have high crests

85
00:05:23,934 --> 00:05:27,366
and deep troughs, the rock can be seen clearly in the

86
00:05:27,388 --> 00:05:30,658
rough waves. But in these calm conditions,

87
00:05:30,754 --> 00:05:34,550
the long swell rolls slowly and is neither high

88
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,050
nor deep, so the rocks are hidden below the waterline.

89
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,958
Captain Salmond rushes on deck, orders the anchor dropped,

90
00:05:42,054 --> 00:05:45,786
the quarterboats to be lowered, and one turn, a stern of

91
00:05:45,808 --> 00:05:49,414
the engines. As the ship backs off, the sea rushes

92
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:52,842
in through the large hole created from striking the rock.

93
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:56,286
The long rolling swell pushes Birkenhead forward,

94
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:59,790
and it strikes again, buckling the plate of the forward

95
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,034
bilge and ripping open the forward bulkheads.

96
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:06,314
The forward compartment and the engine room flood.

97
00:06:06,442 --> 00:06:09,554
Over. A hundred troopers sleeping below deck are

98
00:06:09,592 --> 00:06:13,090
drowned in their bunks. The surviving officers, men,

99
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,898
women and children assemble on deck. Captain Salmond orders

100
00:06:16,914 --> 00:06:20,642
Lieutenant Colonel Seaton, the senior military officer aboard,

101
00:06:20,706 --> 00:06:23,954
to send men to man the bilge pumps.

102
00:06:24,082 --> 00:06:27,302
60 men are assigned to the pumps, 60 to man

103
00:06:27,356 --> 00:06:31,126
the lifeboat tackles, and the remaining men assemble on the poop

104
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:34,826
deck towards the back of the ship in an effort to lower the

105
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:38,010
stern and in turn raise the bough.

106
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:42,222
The women and children are placed in the ship's cutter, which is

107
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:45,962
lying alongside. Captain Salmond orders two further

108
00:06:46,026 --> 00:06:49,758
large boats, each capable of carrying 150 people,

109
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:53,530
to be launched. The first is immediately swamped and lost,

110
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:57,598
while the second can't be launched because the tackle blocks haven't been maintained

111
00:06:57,694 --> 00:07:01,006
and the ropes don't run through them. This leaves

112
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,550
only the cutter and three small lifeboats to take men aboard.

113
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:09,074
The surviving officers and men now assemble on the poop deck,

114
00:07:09,122 --> 00:07:12,326
where Lieutenant Colonel SetoN calls for his officers and

115
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:16,594
men to maintain discipline and order. Everyone is silent.

116
00:07:16,722 --> 00:07:19,894
The only sounds in the air are Captain Salmon quietly

117
00:07:19,942 --> 00:07:23,638
reminding his men to stay calm, the horses kicking on deck

118
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:27,462
and a small swell rolling up on the side of the ship.

119
00:07:27,606 --> 00:07:30,758
Ten minutes after Birkenhead first strikes the rock.

120
00:07:30,854 --> 00:07:34,234
With the engine still going asturn, Birkenhead strikes

121
00:07:34,282 --> 00:07:38,762
the rock a third and final time. Tearing open the bottom plates.

122
00:07:38,906 --> 00:07:42,566
The ship breaks into just behind the main mast.

123
00:07:42,698 --> 00:07:46,238
The funnel collapses and goes overboard. The four parts

124
00:07:46,254 --> 00:07:50,606
of the ship sinks rapidly. The stern section, now heavily crowded

125
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:53,250
with men, begins to flounder and sink.

126
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,354
Captain salmon calls out all who can swim. Jump overboard

127
00:07:58,402 --> 00:08:02,098
and swim for the boats. Lieutenant Colonel Seton

128
00:08:02,194 --> 00:08:05,378
realises that order will cause a rush for the cutter

129
00:08:05,474 --> 00:08:08,806
and the three small lifeboats, which risks swamping

130
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:12,726
them, endangering the lives of the women and children. He orders

131
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:16,294
all troops to stand fast. Only three troopers

132
00:08:16,342 --> 00:08:20,614
break ranks and swim for the Qatar. The nine cavalry horses

133
00:08:20,662 --> 00:08:23,946
are released and driven into the sea. One breaks

134
00:08:23,978 --> 00:08:27,066
its leg and is quickly killed by great white sharks.

135
00:08:27,178 --> 00:08:29,674
The other eight make it safely to shore.

136
00:08:29,802 --> 00:08:33,766
Khanspai is one of the world's great white shark hotspots.

137
00:08:33,898 --> 00:08:37,218
The cold Benguela Current and the warm Mozambique Current

138
00:08:37,304 --> 00:08:41,374
collide in this region, both bringing a supply of nutrients that filter

139
00:08:41,422 --> 00:08:45,134
up the food chain. These African great white sharks feed

140
00:08:45,182 --> 00:08:48,998
predominantly on the large seal population in the area and

141
00:08:49,084 --> 00:08:52,386
are happy to supplement that diet with a few British soldiers

142
00:08:52,418 --> 00:08:56,306
if the opportunity presents itself. The soldiers

143
00:08:56,338 --> 00:08:59,738
and their surviving officers stand fast, not moving,

144
00:08:59,824 --> 00:09:03,610
as the Birkenhead sinks beneath them. Barely 20 minutes

145
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,494
after striking the rock. Some soldiers do manage to swim

146
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:10,454
the 2 miles to shore. Many drown,

147
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:14,314
die of exposure, or are killed by the frenzied

148
00:09:14,362 --> 00:09:17,962
great white sharks. Early the next day, the schooner Lionesse

149
00:09:18,026 --> 00:09:21,326
discovers the cutter takes on board the women and children as

150
00:09:21,348 --> 00:09:24,846
well as survivors from one of the small lifeboats, then heads

151
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:27,774
for Birkenhead's location. Arriving in the afternoon,

152
00:09:27,822 --> 00:09:31,294
Lionesse finds 40 survivors clinging to Birkenhead's rigging

153
00:09:31,342 --> 00:09:35,294
and takes them on board. The total number of persons aboard the Birkenhead

154
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:38,562
at the time of the disaster has always been uncertain.

155
00:09:38,706 --> 00:09:41,874
An estimate of 638 is published

156
00:09:41,922 --> 00:09:45,426
in the Times newspaper in London. The survivors consist

157
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:48,270
of 113 soldiers of all ranks,

158
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:52,070
six Royal Navy Marines, 54 sailors of all ranks,

159
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:55,526
seven women, 13 children and one civilian.

160
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:59,642
A total of 194 men, women and children,

161
00:09:59,776 --> 00:10:02,030
444 men died.

162
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:07,594
The traditional wooden naval ships at the time, or a ship designed

163
00:10:07,642 --> 00:10:11,374
without watertight bulkhead compartments, would have broken up more

164
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:14,402
quickly and the death toll would likely have been higher.

165
00:10:14,536 --> 00:10:18,494
The stronger metal gave some protection from the rock, and the watertight

166
00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:22,194
bulkheads slowed the flooding, which gave the crew enough time to

167
00:10:22,232 --> 00:10:25,954
evacuate some of the survivors. Several sailors are

168
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:29,326
court martialed aboard HMS Victory in Portsmouth on eigth

169
00:10:29,358 --> 00:10:32,882
of May, 1852. The court case generated

170
00:10:32,946 --> 00:10:36,630
an enormous amount of interest from the British public because

171
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,794
none of Birkenhead's senior officers survived the accident. No one

172
00:10:40,832 --> 00:10:43,974
is held responsible. A lighthouse standing 18

173
00:10:44,022 --> 00:10:47,574
meters tall with a light that's visible for 25 nautical miles

174
00:10:47,622 --> 00:10:51,690
out to sea, was built at Danger Point in 1895.

175
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,482
In 1936, a remembrance plate to the Birkenhead

176
00:10:55,546 --> 00:10:59,594
was affixed to the base of the lighthouse by the Naval League of South Africa.

177
00:10:59,722 --> 00:11:03,082
The discipline and valor of the officers and troops aboard Birkenhead,

178
00:11:03,146 --> 00:11:06,978
together with the decision to place the women and children in the Qatar before

179
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:11,406
anyone else, has led to what is now known as the Birkenhead Drill,

180
00:11:11,518 --> 00:11:14,546
or more commonly accepted as women and children.

181
00:11:14,648 --> 00:11:15,300
