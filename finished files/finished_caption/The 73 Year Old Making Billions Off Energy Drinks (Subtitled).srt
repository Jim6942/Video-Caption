1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,626
How is it possible that the best performing stock of the last 30 years isn't

2
00:00:03,658 --> 00:00:06,926
a tech company? While companies like Amazon, Apple, and Nvidia have

3
00:00:06,948 --> 00:00:10,254
created billions of dollars worth of value by bringing new, innovative tech

4
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:13,838
to enterprise and consumer audiences, they still aren't number one.

5
00:00:13,924 --> 00:00:17,822
In fact, the best performing company of the last 30 years does one simple

6
00:00:17,876 --> 00:00:20,942
thing extremely well. They sell caffeinated sugar water.

7
00:00:20,996 --> 00:00:24,946
That slims your options down. But it isn't Coca Cola or Pepsi. It's Monster

8
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:28,742
Energy. Since their IPO in 1990, Monster has grown by almost

9
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:33,174
200,000%. To put this into perspective, if you invested $10,000

10
00:00:33,212 --> 00:00:37,094
into Monster, you would have made 19.2 million. On the flip side,

11
00:00:37,132 --> 00:00:40,774
if you were to put $10,000 into Amazon, you'd get $1.4

12
00:00:40,812 --> 00:00:44,246
million less. Now, of course, Monster started as a penny stock,

13
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:47,354
so insane metrics like this are easy to hack. But this type of

14
00:00:47,392 --> 00:00:51,114
sustained success over a 30 year time frame is no fluke. How is this

15
00:00:51,152 --> 00:00:54,406
possible? Monster isn't just another Cinderella story for business owners

16
00:00:54,438 --> 00:00:57,930
to gawk at. In fact, there are four key lessons that, when implemented correctly,

17
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,390
will amplify the momentum of your business. How does a company perform

18
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,226
so well and get so little time in the spotlight? The news cycle is constantly

19
00:01:05,258 --> 00:01:09,166
dominated by titans of industry like Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Elon Musk.

20
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:12,642
Yet we never hear about the founder of Monster. And while we're at it,

21
00:01:12,696 --> 00:01:16,366
who the hell even is the founder of Monster? Morgan and Morgan law firm

22
00:01:16,398 --> 00:01:19,746
is set to file more than 100 lawsuits against the makers of drinks

23
00:01:19,778 --> 00:01:23,442
like Monster. Tonight, a lawsuit alleges one of those energy drinks

24
00:01:23,506 --> 00:01:26,646
could be linked to a death. Beyond the spreadsheets and stock market,

25
00:01:26,748 --> 00:01:30,166
the birth of Monster is an amazing story of shrewd marketing efforts,

26
00:01:30,278 --> 00:01:33,242
endless controversy, fierce competition, and, of course,

27
00:01:33,296 --> 00:01:36,860
sleepless nights. This is the secret history of monster energy.

28
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,818
The monster we know today exists because of the iron will of one man.

29
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:47,434
That man is Rodney Sachs. Now, if you've never heard of Rodney Sachs,

30
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:50,798
don't be shocked. He keeps a relatively low profile and stays out of

31
00:01:50,804 --> 00:01:54,590
the news. He doesn't even have social media. It's nearly impossible to find any information

32
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,874
on the 73 year old billionaire. He's never taken an interview about his

33
00:01:57,912 --> 00:02:01,198
life and keeps a laser focus on building the monster brand,

34
00:02:01,294 --> 00:02:04,546
not his own personal brand. But once you do the research, you'll find that his

35
00:02:04,568 --> 00:02:08,534
story should be studied by every wouldbe entrepreneur. Rodney was born in 1949

36
00:02:08,572 --> 00:02:11,842
in Johannesburg, South Africa, to Jewish Lithuanian immigrants.

37
00:02:11,906 --> 00:02:15,574
Rodney had a typical South African upbringing and didn't really show any

38
00:02:15,612 --> 00:02:19,106
particular signs of being a future billionaire. He didn't go to fancy schools

39
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:23,018
like Harvard or Stanford. Instead, he stayed in South Africa and studied law at

40
00:02:23,024 --> 00:02:27,014
a local university. But it was when he began his career, his true trajectory began

41
00:02:27,062 --> 00:02:30,806
to show itself. After graduation, he took a job at South Africa's largest

42
00:02:30,838 --> 00:02:34,614
corporate law firm and rose through the ranks like a rocket. During his tenure,

43
00:02:34,662 --> 00:02:38,046
he became the youngest person ever to be promoted to partner. He stayed for

44
00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:41,294
20 years and eventually became a senior partner of the firm, where many

45
00:02:41,332 --> 00:02:44,442
would ride off into the sunset of their career. But not Rodney.

46
00:02:44,506 --> 00:02:47,778
Rodney had been to the top of the Big Law Mountain. He'd achieved a

47
00:02:47,784 --> 00:02:51,582
level of prestige that law students spend their lives dreaming of. He then realized

48
00:02:51,646 --> 00:02:55,214
it wasn't for him. As Peter Thiel said, big law is a strange

49
00:02:55,262 --> 00:02:58,598
place. After years of devotion to his craft, Rodney had come to

50
00:02:58,604 --> 00:03:02,546
the same conclusion. He wanted to start fresh. So, like many entrepreneurs, he packed

51
00:03:02,578 --> 00:03:06,470
up his belongings, his family, and his career, and moved to Southern California.

52
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,778
The year is 1989. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is one

53
00:03:12,784 --> 00:03:16,074
of the top movies of the year. The 49 ers defeated the Bengals to win

54
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:19,450
Super Bowl 23, and most importantly, the Berlin Wall

55
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,374
fell, signaling the end of communism in continental Europe. Countries that

56
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:27,214
once had barren grocery stores are now seeing rapid amounts of growth and

57
00:03:27,252 --> 00:03:31,246
new, globally produced products. Quickly, one big winner starts dominating the

58
00:03:31,268 --> 00:03:34,926
fray. Red Bull gives you wings Red Bull was the model of global success.

59
00:03:35,028 --> 00:03:38,558
The original Red Bull was named Krating Dang. It was a working class staple

60
00:03:38,574 --> 00:03:41,614
in Thailand. After some ingredient adaptations, carbonation,

61
00:03:41,662 --> 00:03:44,766
and intense marketing efforts, Red Bull became Europe's favorite

62
00:03:44,798 --> 00:03:48,146
drink. Clubs from Manchester to Munich stocked the beverage, and it

63
00:03:48,168 --> 00:03:52,262
fueled a vibrant party scene. While it wasn't until 1996 and 1997

64
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:55,346
that Red Bull would sell its first can in America and South Africa,

65
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:59,078
respectively, Rodney had noticed the trend, and it piqued his interest.

66
00:03:59,164 --> 00:04:02,790
But Rodney was convinced his opportunities lay in another product category,

67
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,706
Smoothies. At the time, smoothies were huge in the US.

68
00:04:05,808 --> 00:04:08,986
Jamba Juice was one of the hottest brands in the country, and lines were

69
00:04:09,008 --> 00:04:12,326
down the block. Rodney saw the chance to produce bottled smoothies that could be sold

70
00:04:12,358 --> 00:04:16,106
anywhere and everywhere. Gyms, convenience stores, swimming pools,

71
00:04:16,138 --> 00:04:19,978
and health stores. This would be his big catch. Only one issue stood

72
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:23,166
in his way. Rodney owned nothing in the United States. So he

73
00:04:23,188 --> 00:04:26,818
did what any first time entrepreneur would do and started raising money. Rodney and

74
00:04:26,824 --> 00:04:30,162
an associate went to their friends and family and raised $6 million

75
00:04:30,216 --> 00:04:33,682
to acquire a publicly traded shell company. This shell company

76
00:04:33,736 --> 00:04:37,454
would serve as a vessel to raise even more money. And acquire an existing

77
00:04:37,502 --> 00:04:40,966
player. If Rodney wanted to bring a new smoothie product to market,

78
00:04:41,068 --> 00:04:44,774
he would need one thing and one thing only, distribution on his own.

79
00:04:44,812 --> 00:04:47,862
He couldn't pull all the pieces together. There had to be a business

80
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:51,354
out there that had a killer distribution network but found itself on

81
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:54,966
hard times. Rodney's big opportunity came to him through an introduction

82
00:04:54,998 --> 00:04:59,062
by an investment banker. The missing puzzle piece would be a business named Hanson's.

83
00:04:59,126 --> 00:05:03,018
Hanson's was a staple of old Hollywood. Established in 1935,

84
00:05:03,104 --> 00:05:06,702
Hanson's got their start providing juices to movie sets. The business

85
00:05:06,756 --> 00:05:10,382
was a family affair and as a result, never became more than a regional success.

86
00:05:10,516 --> 00:05:13,794
They built more manufacturing facilities to get into different verticals like

87
00:05:13,832 --> 00:05:18,046
foods and sodas, but never quite reached nationwide popularity.

88
00:05:18,158 --> 00:05:21,838
In 1988, after a period of aggressive overexpansion,

89
00:05:21,934 --> 00:05:25,502
Hanson's had to file for bankruptcy. They sold off their manufacturing

90
00:05:25,566 --> 00:05:29,014
capabilities to Tropicana to pay off some of the debts and had their

91
00:05:29,052 --> 00:05:32,614
name acquired by the California Copackers Corporation. While many

92
00:05:32,652 --> 00:05:36,514
would see Hanson's as a dead company, Rodney saw a diamond in the rough.

93
00:05:36,562 --> 00:05:40,466
It had the one thing he needed, distribution. Hansen's pre existing independent

94
00:05:40,498 --> 00:05:44,006
distribution network would give him a proper foundation to build his Smoothie

95
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:47,686
empire. All he needed to do was turn around the operation and launch the smoothie

96
00:05:47,718 --> 00:05:50,618
line. From there, it would be smooth sailing, or so he thought.

97
00:05:50,704 --> 00:05:54,422
So, in 1992, with his heart set on Hanson's, Rodney and his partner

98
00:05:54,486 --> 00:05:57,934
purchased the business for a grand total of 14 and a half million dollars.

99
00:05:58,052 --> 00:06:01,578
Now, that's almost double the amount that Rodney and his associate raised. So how'd

100
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:05,054
they get access to 14.5 million so quickly? The most likely answer

101
00:06:05,092 --> 00:06:08,030
is that the investment banker that they were working with set up an LBO,

102
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,506
or leveraged buyout. Working with the bank, Rodney and Co. Took out debt to

103
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:15,486
finance the acquisition. Remember how Elon worked with Goldman Sachs and J. P. Morgan Chase

104
00:06:15,518 --> 00:06:18,706
to purchase Twitter? Same principle before the ink dried. They were

105
00:06:18,728 --> 00:06:22,326
losing money by the minute and only had twelve employees. The first four

106
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:26,118
years of his time as CEO include consolidating costs to put Hanson's on

107
00:06:26,124 --> 00:06:29,938
the road to profitability. The launch of the smoothie line shortened the gap towards profitability.

108
00:06:30,034 --> 00:06:34,074
In the first nine months of sales. In 1995, the smoothie line brought in

109
00:06:34,112 --> 00:06:37,946
one third of the company's revenue. The next year, Hanson's was able to report a

110
00:06:37,968 --> 00:06:41,082
profit of $375,000. The very next year,

111
00:06:41,136 --> 00:06:44,210
Red Bull launched in the US and quickly became the number one player

112
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,294
in the category, a title they still hold today. What had only

113
00:06:47,332 --> 00:06:51,386
slightly caught Rodney's attention before was now knocking on his door. The Hanson's executive

114
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:54,526
team was excited about this new category, and they quickly launched their

115
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:57,778
own product. With minimal branding and a little bit of work in the lab.

116
00:06:57,864 --> 00:07:01,474
Rodney launched Hansen's energy with a skinny 8.4

117
00:07:01,512 --> 00:07:05,006
fluid ounce can in 1997. To some fanfare. But it wasn't

118
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:08,338
a slam dunk. Success like Red Bull was. Over the course of the next couple

119
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,730
of years, Hansen's energy spawned new flavors and energy blends.

120
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,654
They tested out Taurine, ginseng, and even creatine, which you've probably seen

121
00:07:15,692 --> 00:07:19,474
in modern energy drinks like bang. While Hansen's energy was a moderate success,

122
00:07:19,612 --> 00:07:23,094
it was being targeted to the wrong audience. Drinks were touted

123
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:26,714
as functional beverages with near medicinal benefits. The drinks would

124
00:07:26,752 --> 00:07:30,746
supposedly fight aging or give consumers stamina. The company focused too much

125
00:07:30,768 --> 00:07:34,134
on the herbs and additives in their drinks and by association,

126
00:07:34,262 --> 00:07:37,294
resonated with the health conscious market. What Red Bull knew

127
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:40,638
was that the real money was in the 18 to 25 year old male market.

128
00:07:40,724 --> 00:07:44,366
Energy drinks struck the biggest chord with them, and they would

129
00:07:44,388 --> 00:07:48,346
become almost like missionaries for the brand. After years of average performance

130
00:07:48,378 --> 00:07:51,986
with Hansen's energy, Rodney went back to the drawing board and started thinking

131
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:55,470
of ways to really compete with Red Bull. They needed a total makeover.

132
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,850
Rodney and his team upped the caffeine content, increased the sugar,

133
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,258
and hired a killer brand designer to give them something extreme.

134
00:08:02,354 --> 00:08:04,550
The result is the original Monster.

135
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,446
As opposed to the 8.4 ounce can Red Bull used.

136
00:08:09,548 --> 00:08:13,526
Monster sold 16 ounce cans. The Insight was simple. This is America.

137
00:08:13,558 --> 00:08:16,874
Bigger the better. You can't have a dainty little can and expect to win

138
00:08:16,912 --> 00:08:20,358
the 18 to 25 year old male market. You need something with some heft.

139
00:08:20,454 --> 00:08:23,706
Additionally, Hanson's offered retailers the same wholesale price as

140
00:08:23,728 --> 00:08:26,798
Red Bull, so they would sell for the same price on the shelf. As a

141
00:08:26,804 --> 00:08:30,490
consumer, you could either have the 8.4 fluid ounce European Red Bull,

142
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,362
or you could have nearly double the size with the 16 ounce American monster

143
00:08:34,426 --> 00:08:37,874
for the same exact price. It was a no brainer. Alongside more

144
00:08:37,912 --> 00:08:42,014
value to the consumer, Monster began an all out marketing blitz. On the retail

145
00:08:42,062 --> 00:08:45,438
front, Monster had amazing retail displays. These displays spoke

146
00:08:45,454 --> 00:08:48,562
to the extreme ethos of the brand and included elements like NASCAR,

147
00:08:48,626 --> 00:08:52,514
dirt bikes, and later on, video games. The brand also made specialty coolers

148
00:08:52,562 --> 00:08:56,642
exclusively for storing monster products at scale. These types of activations

149
00:08:56,706 --> 00:09:00,006
add up, and Monster soon found themselves with great footing in

150
00:09:00,028 --> 00:09:03,514
retail. Monster was flying off the shelves. One business owner loved working

151
00:09:03,552 --> 00:09:07,466
with the brand so much that he commissioned a custom built metal display rack for

152
00:09:07,488 --> 00:09:11,286
his gas station. But their efforts went beyond retail. Monster copied Red Bull's

153
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:14,650
Ambassador network and launched it on college campuses across the country.

154
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,694
You couldn't go to class without an ambassador giving you a can of the new

155
00:09:17,732 --> 00:09:20,974
drink. However, the cornerstone of their strategy was in the form of

156
00:09:21,012 --> 00:09:24,606
promotions. The early marketing thesis for Monster was simple. If an 18 year

157
00:09:24,628 --> 00:09:27,874
old guy in the 90s thought it was cool, then Monster would sponsor it.

158
00:09:27,912 --> 00:09:31,150
On the extreme sports side, Monster put their logos on all sorts of equipment.

159
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,338
Dirt bikes, skateboards, snowboards. Then they jumped into music.

160
00:09:34,424 --> 00:09:37,666
Acts like suicidal tendencies and corn were given wristbands with

161
00:09:37,688 --> 00:09:41,378
the Monster logo and were paid to drink out of monster cans on stage.

162
00:09:41,474 --> 00:09:45,238
But more often than not, they weren't even drinking Monster. They were drinking water

163
00:09:45,324 --> 00:09:48,070
just out of monster cans. It was a great branding move.

164
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,526
Monster became a massive part of the late 90s early 2000s cultural

165
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:55,082
zeitgeist, and their revenue reflected that. Going into the mid 2000s,

166
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:59,690
Monster entered a period of rapid growth. The Beast was finally unleashed.

167
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,038
Hey, diecast, want to pick me up? After the launch of

168
00:10:05,044 --> 00:10:09,194
Monster in 2002, Hansen's sales more than doubled and profits quadrupled.

169
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:12,366
From that point forward, it was grind time for Rodney and the team. The most

170
00:10:12,388 --> 00:10:15,646
important objective, building out the sales and marketing team to move more product.

171
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:20,030
At the time of the launch of Monster, Hanson's employed 108 total employees,

172
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:23,950
with the marketing and sales department housing about 66 employees.

173
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:27,410
In 2005, that number jumped to 293 total

174
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,998
employees, with 217 employees in marketing and sales,

175
00:10:31,084 --> 00:10:34,246
just a huge amount of salespeople that increased headcount came

176
00:10:34,268 --> 00:10:37,894
with increased growth. In 2005, Monster had captured 18%

177
00:10:37,932 --> 00:10:41,474
of the total energy drink market. And while Hanson's was still in Red Bull

178
00:10:41,522 --> 00:10:44,794
shadow, they were on the path to eclipsing them with a growth rate of three

179
00:10:44,832 --> 00:10:47,974
X more. Now was the time to put the pedal to the metal. Hanson's began

180
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:51,062
experimenting with other flavors and brands to drive more revenue.

181
00:10:51,126 --> 00:10:55,422
Products like Joker, Mad Energy, Roomba, Samba, Tango, and Lost Energy

182
00:10:55,556 --> 00:10:58,730
hit shelves across the nation, but delivered mild results.

183
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:02,734
Joker was nearly identical to Monster with two changes. One, there was a

184
00:11:02,772 --> 00:11:06,382
slight variation in taste. And two, it was only sold in Circle K

185
00:11:06,436 --> 00:11:09,538
convenience stores. Joker was more of a success for Circle K than it was

186
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:12,866
for Monster. So the brand was sold off to the convenience store chain in

187
00:11:12,888 --> 00:11:16,130
2010. But that wasn't the only fat being trimmed. In 2010,

188
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,306
after years of low sales, Monster discontinued the product line. And Roomba,

189
00:11:20,338 --> 00:11:23,746
Samba, and Tango were no More. Lost Energy was discontinued

190
00:11:23,778 --> 00:11:27,234
the same year. The problem with all these beverages was that they weren't standout

191
00:11:27,282 --> 00:11:30,422
hits like the original Monster. Hanson's had spent a fortune building

192
00:11:30,476 --> 00:11:33,818
brand equity with their Monster name, so why not use It? The only way to

193
00:11:33,824 --> 00:11:36,934
launch new and successful products was to stay under the brand.

194
00:11:36,982 --> 00:11:41,066
Umbrella drinks like Monsters Zero Sugar and Monster Zero Carb were aimed at

195
00:11:41,088 --> 00:11:44,958
the health conscious crowd that were originally captivated by Hanson's energy.

196
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:48,314
Monster Java and Monster Rehab took notes from Roomba.

197
00:11:48,362 --> 00:11:51,726
Samba and Tango released coffee and tea blends to become part of

198
00:11:51,748 --> 00:11:55,358
consumers'morning routines. The executive team realized they didn't have to

199
00:11:55,364 --> 00:11:58,082
rely on other brands like Lost to sell their product.

200
00:11:58,216 --> 00:12:01,486
Monster had the brand that moved the product. They stuck

201
00:12:01,518 --> 00:12:05,314
to the Monster brand. And now all of these products are successful and still

202
00:12:05,352 --> 00:12:08,898
around today. In a final changing of the guard in 2011, the business

203
00:12:08,984 --> 00:12:12,966
ditched the Hanson's name and became Monster Energy. They found something that

204
00:12:12,988 --> 00:12:16,258
worked, and they were going to stick to it. More shelf space for Monster turned

205
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:19,698
into more lines of revenue, and Monster was entering its heyday.

206
00:12:19,794 --> 00:12:23,242
But that success came at a cost. We've all heard it before. The energy

207
00:12:23,296 --> 00:12:26,954
drinks were the best thing for your health. But now some say they may

208
00:12:26,992 --> 00:12:30,074
be killing you. Is there a consideration to putting an age

209
00:12:30,112 --> 00:12:33,566
restriction on energy drinks? Absolutely. We're looking at the

210
00:12:33,588 --> 00:12:36,746
possibility of defining it as 18 or older,

211
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:40,590
or 19 or older. The number of people who go to the emergency room

212
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,482
after drinking energy drinks has doubled.

213
00:12:43,546 --> 00:12:46,926
Monster was thrust into a big controversy. As public health concerns began

214
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,466
to dominate the airwaves. Regulators and the media were going for their

215
00:12:50,488 --> 00:12:54,478
throats. It wasn't long before Rodney Sachs found himself in a congressional hearing explaining

216
00:12:54,494 --> 00:12:58,466
the safety of his beverages to bureaucrats. But this regulatory attention only played

217
00:12:58,498 --> 00:13:01,794
into Monster's hand. Monster became edgy. All of a sudden,

218
00:13:01,842 --> 00:13:05,938
Monster was the drink your parents, your teachers, and your congressional representatives didn't

219
00:13:05,954 --> 00:13:10,006
want you drinking. Monster's target demo loved that. They liked being part of

220
00:13:10,028 --> 00:13:13,846
something that felt countercultural. But Monster was only getting started. After the hearing,

221
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:17,482
the FDA issued a letter stating that they would not be taking any action against

222
00:13:17,536 --> 00:13:20,182
Monster or any other energy drink brands.

223
00:13:20,326 --> 00:13:24,086
Monster's shares surged 13% upward. Without the regulators

224
00:13:24,118 --> 00:13:27,754
on their back, Monster began to mature and grow as a brand. In 2014,

225
00:13:27,802 --> 00:13:31,018
Monster had finally reached full maturity, and Coca Cola signed

226
00:13:31,034 --> 00:13:34,618
a deal to acquire a 16.7% stake in

227
00:13:34,644 --> 00:13:38,450
Monster for a total sum of 2.15 billion and become

228
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,002
Monster's primary distributor. This wasn't a defensive move

229
00:13:42,056 --> 00:13:46,142
against regulators, but rather an offensive move to keep increasing Monster's growth

230
00:13:46,206 --> 00:13:49,714
in the world of beverages. Coke has the single best distribution network

231
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:53,122
ever. The saying used to be all roads lead to Rome.

232
00:13:53,186 --> 00:13:57,666
But today it's more like all roads lead to a Coke distributor. This move embedded

233
00:13:57,698 --> 00:14:01,130
Monster into Coke's international distribution system in a way

234
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,198
that would pour gasoline on MonsTer's international growth.

235
00:14:04,294 --> 00:14:07,866
In other words, Monster now had the tools to take on Red Bull around the

236
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:11,482
world, all thanks to coke. Monster isn't just another Cinderella story

237
00:14:11,536 --> 00:14:14,574
for business owners to gawk at. In fact, there are four key lessons that,

238
00:14:14,612 --> 00:14:18,462
when implemented correctly, will amplify the momentum of your business. The first

239
00:14:18,516 --> 00:14:22,254
lesson is brand adherence. Branding is a big deal. Imagine this

240
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:25,886
scenario if Nike announced they were going to open a hotel.

241
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:29,074
You'd have a clear idea of what that would look like. There would be an

242
00:14:29,112 --> 00:14:33,214
awesome gym, a massive sports memorabilia museum, and expert

243
00:14:33,262 --> 00:14:36,434
taught fitness classes available around the clock. That's the power

244
00:14:36,472 --> 00:14:40,262
of a real brand. Now imagine if Hyatt Hotels said

245
00:14:40,316 --> 00:14:43,606
they were going to make a shoe. I couldn't even tell you what color the

246
00:14:43,628 --> 00:14:46,866
shoe would be in this situation. Hanson's was Hyatt

247
00:14:46,898 --> 00:14:50,286
and Monster was Nike. Remember back to the launch of Hanson's natural

248
00:14:50,338 --> 00:14:53,450
energy? While the energy drink market was wide open for opportunity,

249
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,322
Hansen's energy just didn't speak to the target consumer. The product

250
00:14:57,376 --> 00:15:01,450
landed flat on its face. Now, remember when Monster launched their first new products

251
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,606
outside of the original Monster? Those weird brands you'd never heard

252
00:15:04,628 --> 00:15:08,286
of, like Tango and Samba. Similar to Hansen's, Natural energy,

253
00:15:08,388 --> 00:15:11,886
the branding didn't entice target consumers enough and the products were

254
00:15:11,908 --> 00:15:15,246
a flop. Develop a damn good brand and stick to it. Lesson number

255
00:15:15,268 --> 00:15:18,834
two, distribution is as, if not more important than product.

256
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:23,182
At every turning point in Monster's history, there was a clear focus on distribution.

257
00:15:23,326 --> 00:15:26,718
Think back to when Rodney was looking to acquire a business. He didn't

258
00:15:26,734 --> 00:15:30,278
buy Hanson's because the name sounded nice or he was interested in the history of

259
00:15:30,284 --> 00:15:33,654
the company. He bought Hanson's because they had everything he needed to build

260
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:36,850
a successful smoothie brand, a solid distribution network.

261
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:40,386
Then, with the launch of Monster, distributors made sure to set up eye

262
00:15:40,418 --> 00:15:43,458
catching retail displays and price Monster competitively with Red

263
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,778
Bull. That launch was a sink or swim moment, and the distributors were like a

264
00:15:46,784 --> 00:15:50,102
life preserver for the brand. Now, with Monster as a mature brand,

265
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:53,642
they're partnering with Coke, the world's best beverage distributor,

266
00:15:53,706 --> 00:15:57,246
to take a swing at the number one energy brand. Third lesson, go where

267
00:15:57,268 --> 00:16:00,686
your customers are. Monster's early successes partially stemmed from its

268
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,738
elite marketing. But their process wasn't very complicated.

269
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:07,438
If anything, it was ultra simple. Monster built its entire brand and marketing

270
00:16:07,454 --> 00:16:11,086
strategy around its customers. While Red Bull had mastered what European 18

271
00:16:11,118 --> 00:16:14,866
to 25 year old males liked. They didn't have an intimate understanding of

272
00:16:14,888 --> 00:16:18,606
the US consumer like Monster did. Monster was sponsoring everything an 18

273
00:16:18,638 --> 00:16:22,566
year old in the 90s would think was cool. Working backwards, Monster identified their

274
00:16:22,588 --> 00:16:26,102
target customer, 18 to 25 year old males, and then asked themselves,

275
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:30,146
what does this demographic like and where do they hang out from there? They spent

276
00:16:30,178 --> 00:16:34,166
money making sure that there wouldn't be any 18 to 25 year olds who didn't

277
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:37,706
know what Monster was. By focusing so intently on their

278
00:16:37,728 --> 00:16:41,654
customers, Monster built more than a drink brand. They built a cultural force,

279
00:16:41,702 --> 00:16:44,894
deciding what was and wasn't cool. But there's a big question of

280
00:16:44,932 --> 00:16:48,814
how. How did Rodney know what would resonate with 18 to 25 year old

281
00:16:48,852 --> 00:16:52,526
American males? When Rodney bought Hanson's in 92, he was

282
00:16:52,548 --> 00:16:55,670
a 42 year old lawyer from South Africa. He wasn't

283
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,978
some snowboarding, skateboarding, BMX riding rock star.

284
00:16:59,064 --> 00:17:02,338
He was just a guy who practiced corporate tax law, arguably one

285
00:17:02,344 --> 00:17:05,746
of the most uncool areas for someone to work in. How did he know what

286
00:17:05,768 --> 00:17:09,586
would be cool? How did he build Monster into a cultural arbiter?

287
00:17:09,698 --> 00:17:13,970
This brings us to our fourth and final lesson, the importance of an open culture.

288
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:17,350
Rodney rarely gives interviews. In fact, finding any information

289
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,586
about him online is a massive struggle. As I said before,

290
00:17:20,688 --> 00:17:24,502
Rodney keeps a very low profile. He has no social media accounts.

291
00:17:24,566 --> 00:17:28,442
But in 2011, Rodney gave BeverageIndustry.com

292
00:17:28,576 --> 00:17:32,026
a Tellall and went no holds barred. In it, he gives away

293
00:17:32,048 --> 00:17:35,118
the secret of Monster success. He says, everyone is able to

294
00:17:35,124 --> 00:17:38,718
share their views and make recommendations from the most junior guys up.

295
00:17:38,804 --> 00:17:42,458
We think everybody should be able to express their views and they should be respected.

296
00:17:42,554 --> 00:17:45,822
When people say, how do you come up with new products? We listen

297
00:17:45,876 --> 00:17:49,538
to the younger guys. A lot of them are internal. What are they doing?

298
00:17:49,624 --> 00:17:52,750
What do they like? When we test our packaging and promotions,

299
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,082
we run it by the younger guys. The key to finding the right product

300
00:17:56,136 --> 00:18:00,262
or packaging for the right demographic is hearing what they say and

301
00:18:00,316 --> 00:18:04,278
understanding them in their own environment, as opposed to trying to figure out

302
00:18:04,364 --> 00:18:08,006
what an artificial focus panel says. But that's not the end if

303
00:18:08,028 --> 00:18:11,366
we stop there. The story is that Rodney built monster into a

304
00:18:11,388 --> 00:18:14,746
powerhouse brand, partnered with Coca Cola, and then rode off

305
00:18:14,768 --> 00:18:18,550
into the sunset. While fitting for a novel, that's just not the reality.

306
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:22,026
The last couple of years have seen heightened competition in the energy driven market from

307
00:18:22,048 --> 00:18:26,622
all directions. Red Bull is still the dominant player in the arena with 42.5%

308
00:18:26,676 --> 00:18:29,966
market share in the US. While new entrants are springing up by the

309
00:18:29,988 --> 00:18:33,674
day, the new kid on the block to watch is Celsius focused on serving

310
00:18:33,722 --> 00:18:37,050
fitness enthusiasts. Their drink provides more caffeine than a

311
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,846
monster, while at a fraction of the calories. Celsius is owned by PepsiCo,

312
00:18:40,878 --> 00:18:44,066
so they're directly at ODS. With Monster, however, Rodney has a plan.

313
00:18:44,168 --> 00:18:47,234
He's going to take the market by force, starting with Bang Energy.

314
00:18:47,352 --> 00:18:50,786
Now, if you're unfamiliar with Bang, they serve the same customer segment

315
00:18:50,818 --> 00:18:54,194
as Celsius, but with more aggressive marketing and more caffeine.

316
00:18:54,322 --> 00:18:57,574
Basically an updated and modernized monster. Their branding is

317
00:18:57,612 --> 00:19:00,994
loud and out there, and the caffeine content of one can of Bang

318
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:04,218
is equivalent to two cans of monster. But what sets them apart from

319
00:19:04,224 --> 00:19:07,270
the rest of the market is their heavy investment in influencer promotions.

320
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:11,254
In 2022, Bang Energy spent the most on YouTube, brand partnerships

321
00:19:11,302 --> 00:19:14,666
of any company in the food and beverage category. But their focus isn't

322
00:19:14,698 --> 00:19:18,474
just on YouTube, they're also crushing TikTok. The company's official hashtag,

323
00:19:18,522 --> 00:19:21,626
Bang Energy, has close to 20 billion views.

324
00:19:21,738 --> 00:19:25,774
Leading the company is Jack O'Walk, who is the brand personified. He wears gaudy

325
00:19:25,822 --> 00:19:29,266
patterned shirts paired with large bang logo chains and

326
00:19:29,288 --> 00:19:32,130
is always stirring up controversy. Remember, folks,

327
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,490
if you ain't training, you ain't gaining.

328
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:39,366
If you ain't banging, you ain't hanging. Does this say yes to the

329
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:42,886
dress or say yes to the breast? So if

330
00:19:42,908 --> 00:19:46,546
you have a creatin peptide, you can solve mental

331
00:19:46,658 --> 00:19:50,098
retardation as we age. Now, you don't have to be an expert

332
00:19:50,114 --> 00:19:53,846
in FDA regulation to guess that Jack's statements might cross

333
00:19:53,878 --> 00:19:57,546
a line, but it wasn't regulators that took him to bat over it. It was

334
00:19:57,568 --> 00:20:00,858
Monster. Back in September of 2018, Monster sued Bang Energy,

335
00:20:00,944 --> 00:20:05,114
alleging that the company was intentionally misleading customers and fraudulently

336
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:08,414
hyping up the benefits of its super creatine. The case was a home

337
00:20:08,452 --> 00:20:12,026
run for Monster, and in September of last year, Bang was forced

338
00:20:12,058 --> 00:20:15,798
to pay $293,000,000 straight to monster.

339
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:19,870
This may have been a bump in the road if PepsiCo, Bang's former distributor,

340
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:23,966
wasn't also awarded $115,000,000 settlement from Bang.

341
00:20:24,078 --> 00:20:27,522
The company was in too deep. With all of these settlements adding up,

342
00:20:27,576 --> 00:20:31,282
Bang had to declare chapter eleven bankruptcy. They were in a rough spot,

343
00:20:31,346 --> 00:20:34,738
and they were close to shutting their doors. But this wasn't the end of Bang's

344
00:20:34,754 --> 00:20:37,730
story. Guess who was there to pick up the pieces? Rodney.

345
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:41,462
In July, a judge gave the green light to the acquisition of Bang Energy

346
00:20:41,516 --> 00:20:45,714
by Monster Energy, allowing Bang to steer clear of chapter Eleven bankruptcy.

347
00:20:45,842 --> 00:20:49,286
Monster now owns one of the hottest names in the market, and they were able

348
00:20:49,308 --> 00:20:52,974
to buy it at discount because of the shrewd legal moves. The stages are set

349
00:20:53,012 --> 00:20:56,442
for Celsius and Bang to clash, but if I were Rodney, I'd be careful.

350
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:59,454
Do you remember how I said Monster was the best performing stock of the last

351
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:02,878
30 years? Well, with the help of the PepsiCo acquisition, Celsius is

352
00:21:02,884 --> 00:21:06,046
the best performing stock of the last five years. I'm doing a whole series on

353
00:21:06,068 --> 00:21:09,214
these kinds of businesses, so subscribe if you want to see more, and thanks

354
00:21:09,252 --> 00:21:09,500
for watching.
