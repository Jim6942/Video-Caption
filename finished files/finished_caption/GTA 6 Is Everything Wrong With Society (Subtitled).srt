1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,386
There's one big question on people's minds. After over a decade

2
00:00:03,418 --> 00:00:07,150
since GTA Five, what does Rockstar have in store this time? The bar

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,510
couldn't possibly be higher. Thanks to its massive release and its online

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,886
economy, GTA Five is probably the highest grossing piece of media of

5
00:00:13,908 --> 00:00:17,502
all time. Never has there been an opening like

6
00:00:17,556 --> 00:00:20,558
this in the entertainment industry. This week,

7
00:00:20,644 --> 00:00:24,478
Grand Theft Auto Five pulled in $1 billion

8
00:00:24,564 --> 00:00:28,374
in deals in three days. No movie or

9
00:00:28,412 --> 00:00:31,926
music release has ever come close to that. I'm here for

10
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:35,462
Grand Theft Auto Five, yeah. Reaching over

11
00:00:35,516 --> 00:00:39,046
$6 billion, a figure that Rockstar would be lucky to match the next time

12
00:00:39,068 --> 00:00:42,806
round. But with a reported development budget between one and $2 billion alone

13
00:00:42,838 --> 00:00:45,754
for GTA Six, people will be expecting the world.

14
00:00:45,872 --> 00:00:48,746
Most of all, people are going to be looking for something that builds on what

15
00:00:48,768 --> 00:00:51,946
GTA Five did so well. The sheer scale of the game was

16
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:55,214
one of the things that really blew people away. The way the world seemed so

17
00:00:55,252 --> 00:00:58,366
alive and the heist missions were dazzling spectacles which acted like

18
00:00:58,388 --> 00:01:02,078
minifinalies. The story and the characters were incredibly well done, if a

19
00:01:02,084 --> 00:01:05,518
little all over the place. You could definitely tell that each plot point had at

20
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:09,146
least 50 writers working on it. But that didn't stop the dialogue from being snappy

21
00:01:09,178 --> 00:01:12,366
and the characters from being some of the funniest and most interesting we've seen in

22
00:01:12,388 --> 00:01:15,394
a long while. At the end of the day, any game where you can steel

23
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:18,502
a blimp has at least something going for it. What cemented it all together,

24
00:01:18,556 --> 00:01:21,602
though, were the mechanics of the game. Everything from the driving,

25
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:25,458
the flying, the combat mechanics, it all worked pretty much perfectly.

26
00:01:25,554 --> 00:01:29,094
A massive step up over the previous games in the series. If any of these

27
00:01:29,132 --> 00:01:32,118
elements were subpar, it would have ruined the entire game.

28
00:01:32,204 --> 00:01:35,514
If the driving felt clunky or stiff, then it would have turned all the long

29
00:01:35,552 --> 00:01:38,758
drives into a chore rather than a welcome change of pace.

30
00:01:38,854 --> 00:01:42,330
Instead, the time you spend driving just seems to disappear. And this focus

31
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,254
on the core mechanics actually being fun over and over again is what's missing from

32
00:01:46,292 --> 00:01:49,946
so many games today. But for GTA, it was what enabled Rockstar

33
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:53,578
to turn it into a massively successful MMO that's been running for nearly

34
00:01:53,594 --> 00:01:57,322
a decade straight. If Rockstar doesn't get these essentials right for GTA

35
00:01:57,386 --> 00:02:00,610
Six, then it might turn out as one of the biggest blunders of all time.

36
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,338
But it's unlikely. So then, what do we know about the game so far?

37
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:07,954
Well, speculation about GTH Six has been going on for years and years now,

38
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:11,606
but it wasn't until 2020 that we learned anything concrete. Even that

39
00:02:11,628 --> 00:02:15,286
was part of a leak from the company. In a Kutaki report, insiders at the

40
00:02:15,308 --> 00:02:18,226
studio said it was still a ways away, but they did add some details.

41
00:02:18,258 --> 00:02:22,306
Even at such an early point, Rockstar has, and still is, infamous for their culture

42
00:02:22,338 --> 00:02:25,814
of crunch and overworking their developers. Anyone who's played Red Dead Redemption

43
00:02:25,862 --> 00:02:28,726
Two will know the sheer amount of time that must have gone into each tiny

44
00:02:28,758 --> 00:02:32,074
detail. So to try and ease the burden, sources of the company said the game

45
00:02:32,112 --> 00:02:35,854
would be limited in scope at first, but expand over time as new content gets

46
00:02:35,892 --> 00:02:39,722
added. Although whether this is just an excuse for Rockstar to repackage paid DLC

47
00:02:39,786 --> 00:02:43,422
is another story. Other than that, though, details were scant. It wasn't until

48
00:02:43,476 --> 00:02:47,274
last year that we really done some other details. Five months after Rockstar officially

49
00:02:47,322 --> 00:02:51,006
announced it was coming out, Bloomberg released a report on some of the upcoming game's

50
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:54,382
main features. We learned that the game would originally start off in Miami,

51
00:02:54,446 --> 00:02:58,094
a fact that was later all but confirmed when development footage was leaked.

52
00:02:58,142 --> 00:03:01,366
It wasn't long before people took some of the buildings they saw and matched them

53
00:03:01,388 --> 00:03:04,614
exactly to some of Miami's real life structures. One detail, though,

54
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:07,654
was that while the map was going to be smaller than usual, we would have

55
00:03:07,692 --> 00:03:10,854
far more indoor locations. Rockstar Games have always been

56
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:14,138
more focused on immersion in a real world, so this will be a welcome

57
00:03:14,224 --> 00:03:17,894
change. On top of this, the game was confirmed to have two protagonists, one male

58
00:03:17,942 --> 00:03:21,482
and one female, maybe a step back from the three main characters of GTA fIve,

59
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:24,966
but still interesting. Not many people base their judgments about a game on the amount

60
00:03:25,008 --> 00:03:27,946
of protagonists anyway, but a few months later and there would be a much larger

61
00:03:27,978 --> 00:03:31,406
leak showing footage from the unfinished game, raw code, and even

62
00:03:31,428 --> 00:03:34,526
some voice acting from scenes in the game. Lots of it was scrubbed by

63
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:38,286
Rockstar shortly afterwards, although what was seen confirmed some early reports about

64
00:03:38,308 --> 00:03:41,166
the game, and the leak actually turned out to be a 17 year old from

65
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:44,574
Britain who had hacked into Rockstar with a fire TV stick in a hotel room,

66
00:03:44,612 --> 00:03:48,226
connected his mobile phone, and it wouldn't be all that surprising if a similar character

67
00:03:48,258 --> 00:03:51,606
ends up in the game itself. But outside of the confirmed details, we can make

68
00:03:51,628 --> 00:03:54,914
a lot of pretty strong predictions based on both what Rockstar's done with their previous

69
00:03:54,962 --> 00:03:58,470
games, as well as a little common sense. But before we continue,

70
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,786
I want to talk about our video sponsor. Have you ever Googled yourself and were

71
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:05,350
shocked to see your personal information exposed on one of those public listing sites?

72
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,350
Databrokers are making a fortune selling your information to robocallers,

73
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,650
spammers and others who want to learn more about you, like where you live.

74
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,594
And that's why I'm excited to tell you about today's sponsor, Aura.

75
00:04:15,642 --> 00:04:18,954
Aura can identify data brokers exposing your info and submit

76
00:04:19,002 --> 00:04:22,106
opt out requests on your behalf. Now, brokers are legally required

77
00:04:22,138 --> 00:04:24,814
to remove your info if you ask them to, but if they make it super

78
00:04:24,852 --> 00:04:28,226
hard to do, let aura handle it for you and you can try aura for

79
00:04:28,248 --> 00:04:31,602
free for two weeks using my link. Aura also does so much to protect

80
00:04:31,656 --> 00:04:35,074
you and your family from online threats you can't see. It's super easy

81
00:04:35,112 --> 00:04:37,826
to set up, and you don't have to download several different apps to get things

82
00:04:37,848 --> 00:04:40,834
like parental controls, antivirus, VPN, password management,

83
00:04:40,882 --> 00:04:45,014
identity theft, insurance, and more. Instead, you get everything in one at an affordable price.

84
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:48,246
So let Aura do the hard work of keeping you safe online so that you

85
00:04:48,268 --> 00:04:51,762
can focus on other tasks with peace of mind. You can either let people continue

86
00:04:51,836 --> 00:04:55,258
to exploit and profit off your private information, or you can go to

87
00:04:55,424 --> 00:04:58,758
forward Slash Moon to start your two week free trial. Also linked

88
00:04:58,774 --> 00:05:02,026
down in the description below, there will almost certainly be an online site of the

89
00:05:02,048 --> 00:05:05,486
game, most likely separate from the single player. GTA's online Shark cards and

90
00:05:05,508 --> 00:05:09,466
microtransaction kept the company afloat for a decade, promising perpetual income

91
00:05:09,498 --> 00:05:12,958
for very little effort. In comparison, their effectiveness is most likely a

92
00:05:12,964 --> 00:05:16,494
large part of why we haven't gotten GTA six sooner. Rockstar were pretty much

93
00:05:16,532 --> 00:05:19,906
releasing a game every year before GTA Online came out. Since then,

94
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:23,170
we've seen just one major release in a decade. Another thing we can almost certainly

95
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,434
expect is a focus on satire. GTA Five was full of it,

96
00:05:26,472 --> 00:05:29,138
as were the other games in the franchise, but today it's going to be a

97
00:05:29,144 --> 00:05:32,146
bit trickier. Past ten years have seen real life surpass fiction

98
00:05:32,178 --> 00:05:36,246
and how absurd and comical it is. Things we laughed at yesterday are normal today,

99
00:05:36,348 --> 00:05:39,206
and so it's hard to imagine how Rockstar and the legions of writers will come

100
00:05:39,228 --> 00:05:42,802
up with anything more crazy than what's in the news. Could life Invader from GTA

101
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:46,266
Five really be renamed into something dumber than Meta? Or could they come up with

102
00:05:46,288 --> 00:05:49,546
anything more redundant than X? How could they even approach how insane an over

103
00:05:49,568 --> 00:05:52,826
the top modern politics is today? Judging by what we saw in the last game,

104
00:05:52,848 --> 00:05:56,682
though, there's a few obvious paths they could take. Two characters from GTA

105
00:05:56,746 --> 00:06:00,398
Five that seem so much more relevant now are Michael's two children, Jimmy and

106
00:06:00,404 --> 00:06:04,154
Tracy. Jimmy is the stereotypical gamer. He's a toxic manchild,

107
00:06:04,202 --> 00:06:07,506
unaware of how awkward he is while also blaming everyone around him for the

108
00:06:07,528 --> 00:06:11,026
fact he spends all days smoking and playing games. If they didn't drill it in

109
00:06:11,048 --> 00:06:14,258
enough already, he's literally got the world entitled tattooed on

110
00:06:14,264 --> 00:06:18,442
his neck. Tracy is on the other side of the coin. A stereotypical blonde airhead,

111
00:06:18,526 --> 00:06:22,370
she goes through life entirely obsessed with status, image, and her own popularity.

112
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,954
She throws tantrums, is even more spored than her brother, and she's painfully

113
00:06:26,002 --> 00:06:29,218
naive. This was RockstaR's over the top but disturbingly accurate

114
00:06:29,234 --> 00:06:33,222
betrayal of teenagers at the time the game came out, and today nothing's really changed

115
00:06:33,286 --> 00:06:36,314
except that these people grew up and now they're the ones setting the example and

116
00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:39,814
guiding social media for everyone younger than them. It's a self perpetuating

117
00:06:39,862 --> 00:06:43,066
cycle that began with people like these characters, and so you can be

118
00:06:43,088 --> 00:06:46,366
sure that Rockstar's gonna roast the hell out of them. The Jimmies and traces of

119
00:06:46,388 --> 00:06:50,142
yesterday are the influencers of today, the most entitled, Degenerate People

120
00:06:50,196 --> 00:06:53,854
making the most money of all, considering how blatant and clearly greedy some

121
00:06:53,892 --> 00:06:57,394
influencers are. Every week, like clockwork, there's another controversy about

122
00:06:57,432 --> 00:07:00,830
some influencer pushing some awful product, usually a scam,

123
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:04,146
whilst failing to hide how stupid they think their audience is. Just look at

124
00:07:04,168 --> 00:07:08,142
one of Pokemon's most recent scandals, trying to sell $28 cookies,

125
00:07:08,206 --> 00:07:11,666
then insulting the people who call her out on it by saying they're just poor

126
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:15,174
and stupid cookies that are just an obvious rebrand or some other more

127
00:07:15,212 --> 00:07:19,410
cheaper cookie, let alone all the crypto scams that influencers like Logan Paul Push.

128
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,906
Equally likely, though, is Rockstar making fun of both the Sims, calling these

129
00:07:22,928 --> 00:07:26,422
people queen unironically so. Ruby Rose is a very popular

130
00:07:26,486 --> 00:07:29,914
individual right now, and she posted this on Twitter. Today I ran into

131
00:07:29,952 --> 00:07:33,374
my number one spinder on OnlyFans and we are blessed with

132
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:36,462
two magnificent pictures. Here on the left,

133
00:07:36,516 --> 00:07:40,142
it is Ruby Rose posing with her number one

134
00:07:40,196 --> 00:07:43,918
piggy bank dumper. Now let's turn our attention to exhibit B and we

135
00:07:43,924 --> 00:07:47,262
can get the statistics. So he has been subscribed to her only fans

136
00:07:47,326 --> 00:07:51,826
for a month and has spent a total of $62,000,

137
00:07:51,928 --> 00:07:55,070
as well as the people spending their whole lives raging in comment sections.

138
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,626
Often, though, they're just the same people. GTA also excels at

139
00:07:58,648 --> 00:08:02,022
specifically deconstructing American culture as well. While lots of other shows,

140
00:08:02,076 --> 00:08:05,334
movies and games do this, GTA does it in such a complete and direct way

141
00:08:05,372 --> 00:08:09,010
that it's unique. Every detail is a masterclass in satirizing America.

142
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,566
From the way the adverts on the radio sound to the ridiculous political campaigns

143
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:16,170
and billboards, it's uncanny how close they are to reality. The same report

144
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,366
says he allegedly used campaign money for a fleshy Las

145
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:22,890
Vegas holiday, a shopping spree at makeup store Sephora,

146
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,474
and for payments to OnlyFans, a site known for adult

147
00:08:26,522 --> 00:08:30,490
entertainment. He's now facing 23 federal charges.

148
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,014
The Saturday is most visible, though, in the names Rockstar gives their fake companies.

149
00:08:34,132 --> 00:08:38,014
Facebook turns to life, Invader Fox becomes Weasel news, and Goldman

150
00:08:38,062 --> 00:08:41,342
Sachs is renamed to Schlonberg Sachs. While they might be juvenile,

151
00:08:41,406 --> 00:08:44,674
these names are working on another level. Beyond crass humor, they're poking fun

152
00:08:44,712 --> 00:08:48,598
at the double speak way that companies name themselves. Some of this ubiquitous today,

153
00:08:48,684 --> 00:08:52,098
companies don't fire people anymore. They downsize, or they restructure.

154
00:08:52,194 --> 00:08:55,442
Reductions in pay or the company's revenue becomes adjustments.

155
00:08:55,506 --> 00:08:59,046
Instead, what began as little more than stupid buzwords in boardroom meetings has

156
00:08:59,068 --> 00:09:02,386
infected every layer of society. Today, companies are so terrified

157
00:09:02,418 --> 00:09:05,462
of the truth in their PR image that the names barely mean anything anymore.

158
00:09:05,526 --> 00:09:09,114
Facebook became meta and Twitter turned into X. Both of the previous names actually

159
00:09:09,152 --> 00:09:12,422
meant something. Facebook actually was a book of faces in the beginning.

160
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:15,726
Now they don't mean anything at all. Even company logos become bland and

161
00:09:15,748 --> 00:09:19,006
featureless. Just compare any big name brand's logo to what it was ten

162
00:09:19,028 --> 00:09:22,494
years ago. Nearly every time, it's just a simplified geometric version of it.

163
00:09:22,532 --> 00:09:25,838
But with GTA Six said to be the most expensive AA game in history,

164
00:09:25,924 --> 00:09:29,358
it might be an issue for Rockstar to properly satirize these megacorporations.

165
00:09:29,454 --> 00:09:32,606
They are one now. It'll take a bit of the momentum out of every shot

166
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:35,938
they take at corporate America when they're a massive part of it. Although it might

167
00:09:35,944 --> 00:09:39,262
not be as big of a problem as people expect. After every GTA

168
00:09:39,326 --> 00:09:42,726
game, and for the entirety of GTA Online, you're invited to get straight back into

169
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,958
the criminal grind. Whatever lessons the protagonists learn about how they

170
00:09:45,964 --> 00:09:49,430
should value their family or get out while they still can always fall away.

171
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,586
If they actually landed, the game would just end. Instead, there's an irony in how

172
00:09:52,608 --> 00:09:56,106
the main character can finish the Rock, become a complete person, learn all

173
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:59,622
these core values about humanity, then get right back into murder and mayhem.

174
00:09:59,686 --> 00:10:03,334
Rockstar are the same. Their character's arc finished with GTA Five. It was the definitive

175
00:10:03,382 --> 00:10:07,162
GTA experience, and they became one of the largest gaming companies in the industry.

176
00:10:07,226 --> 00:10:10,990
But now they're back to it all over again. But bigger and better. Rockstar themselves

177
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,078
are large enough to be satirized in the GTA game. If only they weren't the

178
00:10:14,084 --> 00:10:17,698
ones making it. This is just one example of the million different ways Rockstar could

179
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:21,202
take on modern culture in GTA Six, there's literally a whole world of options

180
00:10:21,256 --> 00:10:24,834
for them. Considering it's taking place in Miami, we're pretty much likely to see some

181
00:10:24,872 --> 00:10:28,350
SoundCloud rappers at the very least, and all the degenerate podcasters.

182
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,526
But overall, the way Rockstar just cuts through the nonsense and

183
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:34,998
goes straight for the jugular is what makes GTA some of the best satire around.

184
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:37,846
The only thing left to see is whether they can keep the ball rolling for

185
00:10:37,868 --> 00:10:41,334
GTA Six. These sorts of massive AA releases only come

186
00:10:41,372 --> 00:10:45,154
along once in a while, and they're always a complete gamble. The more highly anticipated

187
00:10:45,202 --> 00:10:48,386
a game is, the bigger risk there is of a complete flop if it doesn't

188
00:10:48,418 --> 00:10:51,614
reach people's expectations. For gaming audiences especially,

189
00:10:51,732 --> 00:10:54,926
the reactions can be a little on the extreme side. Considering people have been

190
00:10:54,948 --> 00:10:58,154
waiting over a decade and the games have had more than a billion dollars thrown

191
00:10:58,202 --> 00:11:00,430
at it, the possibilities are limitless.
