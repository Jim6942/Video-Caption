00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,106
In the early morning hours of October 7, 2023, the IDF's

2
00:00:04,138 --> 00:00:07,214
930 3rd Nahal Brigade quickly jumped into their

3
00:00:07,252 --> 00:00:11,274
brand new, untested Aton armored fighting vehicles. They raced

4
00:00:11,322 --> 00:00:15,306
off from their quick reaction post in northeastern Israel. The column sped

5
00:00:15,338 --> 00:00:18,654
at the breakneck speed of 120 km/hour

6
00:00:18,772 --> 00:00:21,834
down Israel's Highway Six. Their mission?

7
00:00:21,962 --> 00:00:25,222
Engage Hamas militants that had launched the terror attack

8
00:00:25,276 --> 00:00:28,626
along Zekum Beach. The militants had amphibiously

9
00:00:28,658 --> 00:00:31,634
infiltrated from Gaza in eight separate boats.

10
00:00:31,762 --> 00:00:34,822
Four Hamas boats were destroyed immediately by the nine

11
00:00:34,876 --> 00:00:38,854
16th Patrol Squadron from Ashad Naval Base before they

12
00:00:38,892 --> 00:00:42,230
even reached the shore. However, the four other boats

13
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,582
successfully made it to the beach and started attacking the Kibutz and the Bajad

14
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:49,946
Four military base in what is now referred to as the

15
00:00:49,968 --> 00:00:53,638
Battle of Zikum. Then the Nahal Brigade, in their atons, rushed to

16
00:00:53,664 --> 00:00:57,246
defend the beachfront. They reportedly got there so quickly they were able

17
00:00:57,268 --> 00:01:00,922
to take out the militants while they were still stuck on the beachhead.

18
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:04,866
But by 07:00 a.m. That morning, Israel had confirmed reports that

19
00:01:04,888 --> 00:01:07,742
their Bahad four base had been overrun.

20
00:01:07,886 --> 00:01:11,822
The Israeli atons immediately began to clear the nearby villages

21
00:01:11,966 --> 00:01:15,730
on their way to the base. This is one of the main recruit training

22
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,186
stations for combat and noncombat arms for the IDF.

23
00:01:19,298 --> 00:01:23,190
What that means is there was at least 90 Green recruits training

24
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,418
here at the time. Six IDF officers were KIA

25
00:01:26,514 --> 00:01:30,138
trying to protect them during the battle that raged on for hours.

26
00:01:30,304 --> 00:01:33,942
One recruit was KIA in the fight. Then the Aton

27
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:38,166
started to regain the upper hand thanks to its remote controlled 50 caliber

28
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:41,594
machine guns, which successfully forced the Hamas militants

29
00:01:41,642 --> 00:01:45,166
to withdraw back into Gaza. An Israeli soldier who

30
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:48,766
participated in the battle said this we reached the area the

31
00:01:48,788 --> 00:01:52,186
fastest. This is our first advantage. We ran

32
00:01:52,218 --> 00:01:55,534
into terrorist vehicles and didn't feel anything. It's a powerful

33
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:59,166
tool. We broke through gates and fences. Then we helped

34
00:01:59,198 --> 00:02:02,626
evacuate the wounded and supply the troops. It would

35
00:02:02,648 --> 00:02:05,966
have taken much longer to prepare and move out with tracked

36
00:02:05,998 --> 00:02:09,620
vehicles to respond in this kind of emergency situation.

37
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,634
In fact, the Battle of Zekem beach was the first time that the eight wheeled

38
00:02:13,682 --> 00:02:17,302
vehicle was ever tested in combat, and it's actually still

39
00:02:17,356 --> 00:02:21,094
just in the introductory testing phases at the IDF. The Aton

40
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:25,126
unit was able to do this without a single casualty. The successful

41
00:02:25,158 --> 00:02:29,158
use of the vehicle prompted the head of the IDF ground forces, Commander Yachty,

42
00:02:29,254 --> 00:02:32,806
to integrate the Aton into plans of the invasion of Gaza

43
00:02:32,838 --> 00:02:36,142
Strip. Critics claimed that the vehicle wasn't scheduled to go into full

44
00:02:36,196 --> 00:02:39,918
service for another entire year until sometime in 2024.

45
00:02:40,004 --> 00:02:43,566
Many opinions started popping up on X Twitter that state that

46
00:02:43,588 --> 00:02:46,958
the vehicle was, quote, prematurely rushed into service.

47
00:02:47,124 --> 00:02:51,234
They claim that the high tech Aton was rushed into battle before they were ready

48
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:55,074
for the test. But what do some of its capabilities tell us about how it

49
00:02:55,112 --> 00:02:58,846
might perform in urban combat? One Israeli soldier proudly

50
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,806
called it the Tesla of APCs because it's extremely high tech,

51
00:03:02,908 --> 00:03:06,738
gives you a smooth ride. And I think he said it before all that controversy.

52
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:10,226
I don't know. I don't follow the drama closely. While there may be some truth

53
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:13,754
to it being rushed out the gate, they actually appear to be functioning well so

54
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:17,542
far. In fact, this article that I found from breaking Defense from October

55
00:03:17,606 --> 00:03:21,162
4, just three days prior to the attack, shows their

56
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,814
exclusive walkthrough of the Aton Armored unit getting used

57
00:03:24,852 --> 00:03:27,498
to the new system and training on it and running drills.

58
00:03:27,594 --> 00:03:31,274
Photos released by the IDF themselves show the Aton

59
00:03:31,322 --> 00:03:34,446
operating on the ground in Gaza in November 2023.

60
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:38,258
We can see this giant explosion plume in the background behind the

61
00:03:38,264 --> 00:03:41,986
vehicle. Sometimes we would use an armored vehicle in a rock simply to take

62
00:03:42,008 --> 00:03:45,934
cover in when we exploded unexploded IEDs nearby. Then we'd

63
00:03:45,982 --> 00:03:49,846
jump back out. But the interesting thing that jumps out from this photo is

64
00:03:49,868 --> 00:03:53,554
that the Aton appears to have been outfitted with Spike antitank guided

65
00:03:53,602 --> 00:03:57,186
missiles and a 50 caliber machine gun. But those spike missiles

66
00:03:57,218 --> 00:04:00,474
aren't going to be engaging enemy tanks. What they're designed for

67
00:04:00,512 --> 00:04:03,738
in Gaza is to strike entrenched Hamas positions that

68
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:07,270
are behind concrete. Its 18 pound missile has a new penetration

69
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,522
blast fragmentation that's used to destroy enemy behind

70
00:04:10,576 --> 00:04:14,094
cover. You might be surprised to learn that the 50 caliber machine gun can have

71
00:04:14,132 --> 00:04:17,598
difficulty cutting through concrete. The second photo from the IDF in

72
00:04:17,604 --> 00:04:21,006
Gaza shows us something interesting. We see a dismounted fire team of

73
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:24,494
IDF soldiers taking cover behind the Aton inside Gaza.

74
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:28,274
This is a common tactic used by mechanized infantry where they

75
00:04:28,312 --> 00:04:32,302
advance alongside the firepower and protection of the vehicle

76
00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:35,906
while dismounted. In the background, we can actually see what looks like the

77
00:04:35,928 --> 00:04:39,126
turret of a Merkava main battle tank. The ATON is

78
00:04:39,148 --> 00:04:42,902
specifically designed to operate alongside the Mercava tank using

79
00:04:42,956 --> 00:04:46,274
their digital network system together, and the two are likely

80
00:04:46,322 --> 00:04:50,070
protecting each other's flanks here in a 360 degree security

81
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,154
zone. Very important in urban warfare. One of the advantages of

82
00:04:54,192 --> 00:04:58,150
this system is that it's reported to have a 1000 kilometer range,

83
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,638
or about 620 miles, before needing to be refueled,

84
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:05,706
which is about 120 miles greater distance than similar counterpart

85
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:09,294
vehicles. This allows you to stay in the fight for a longer period of

86
00:05:09,332 --> 00:05:12,990
time. Sustaining operations in Gaza is difficult for

87
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,626
Israel because extending these logistics lines, even just a

88
00:05:16,648 --> 00:05:20,098
few miles into hostile territory, is a tough job.

89
00:05:20,264 --> 00:05:23,278
This is a classic quick reaction force mission,

90
00:05:23,374 --> 00:05:26,606
and it's exactly the kind of response these relatively new

91
00:05:26,648 --> 00:05:29,894
vehicles were designed for. The key characteristics of a quick

92
00:05:29,932 --> 00:05:33,522
reaction force are speed, flexibility, and readiness.

93
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,446
What this means is that these vehicles cannot afford the luxury of being

94
00:05:37,468 --> 00:05:41,274
a high maintenance vehicle. Part of the reason why the Aton was effective in

95
00:05:41,312 --> 00:05:45,050
this mission is because it can carry twelve soldiers, including nine

96
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,002
dismounted infantry, a full squad that can rush out, and three

97
00:05:49,056 --> 00:05:53,150
vehicle crew that stay on the vehicle to maintain a support by fire

98
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,018
position. The Aton vehicle is uniquely well suited for Israel

99
00:05:57,114 --> 00:06:00,734
because it's designed to traverse mountainous terrain, environments that are

100
00:06:00,772 --> 00:06:04,666
found in the Golan Heights. The reason wheels work in its favor

101
00:06:04,788 --> 00:06:08,830
is because tracked vehicles on tanks tear up normal roads.

102
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,366
And ironically, they wear out much faster on a typical highway

103
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,254
than it would on an offroad terrain. This is why anytime

104
00:06:16,302 --> 00:06:19,522
we see tracked vehicles deployed over long distances,

105
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:23,266
they're often loaded onto truck beds or trains. But that's

106
00:06:23,298 --> 00:06:26,598
a slow and cumbersome process and doesn't bode well if

107
00:06:26,604 --> 00:06:30,726
you need to respond to immediate threats along your border, like bringing

108
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:34,566
supplies to the front lines. And they're also great for evacuating

109
00:06:34,678 --> 00:06:38,630
wounded troops. Quickly back to the rear. The new Iron Fist

110
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:42,206
active protection system found on the Aton armor could be

111
00:06:42,228 --> 00:06:46,254
used as a screening force to knock down incoming RPGs and

112
00:06:46,292 --> 00:06:50,426
clear a path for heavier tanks. The Hebrew name Aton

113
00:06:50,538 --> 00:06:53,774
actually means steadfast or strong, which gives us some

114
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:57,726
insight into what type of capabilities they want to project with this armored

115
00:06:57,758 --> 00:07:01,186
vehicle. But looking at the Aton, you might think to yourself, wait a

116
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:04,686
second. Isn't that just an Israeli version of the striker

117
00:07:04,718 --> 00:07:07,730
or Boxer? Isn't that just a ripoff of the LAV?

118
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,766
Wait a second. Actually, why do all of those different vehicles look the

119
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:14,802
same? It can be tough to classify a vehicle like the atom,

120
00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:18,354
but most people call it an armored fighting vehicle, as opposed

121
00:07:18,402 --> 00:07:22,326
to an infantry fighting vehicle classification or armored personnel

122
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,354
carrier. All of these different things can be similar,

123
00:07:25,472 --> 00:07:29,126
but they're usually distinguished based on its level of firepower.

124
00:07:29,238 --> 00:07:32,938
But the visual aesthetics is where most of the similarities end.

125
00:07:33,104 --> 00:07:36,606
Like the rest of their armored fleet, the Israeli Defense Force has

126
00:07:36,628 --> 00:07:39,966
a unique set of requirements that set this vehicle apart from its

127
00:07:39,988 --> 00:07:42,890
counterparts. But before we answer that. So the animations,

128
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:46,642
video editing, and research in this video was only made possible thanks

129
00:07:46,696 --> 00:07:50,242
to this episode's sponsor, goat guns. But before you ask

130
00:07:50,296 --> 00:07:53,566
me, no, they don't fire. Can you even imagine the lawsuits

131
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,314
if they did? I mean, just think about that for a second. But history and

132
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:01,014
military buffs, former soldiers and gun nuts alike, love getting

133
00:08:01,052 --> 00:08:04,578
these one third scale mini model goat guns as a gift.

134
00:08:04,674 --> 00:08:08,098
The thing that really blew me away was the working dummy rounds

135
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:11,994
that you can actually load into the magazines and the bolts that slide back just

136
00:08:12,032 --> 00:08:15,814
like the real thing. Every detail has been faithfully recreated

137
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:19,446
to deliver an authentic experience. If you're looking for the perfect gift

138
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:23,118
this holiday season, look no further. From the iconic AR 15

139
00:08:23,204 --> 00:08:27,386
to the classic AK 47, these miniaturized masterpieces aren't

140
00:08:27,418 --> 00:08:30,606
just for display, they're interactive, allowing you to assemble and

141
00:08:30,628 --> 00:08:34,730
disassemble these models, providing a handson understanding of firearms,

142
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:38,078
goat guns make a unique and impressive addition to any collection.

143
00:08:38,174 --> 00:08:41,854
Click the link in the description or the pinned comment below to get yours

144
00:08:41,902 --> 00:08:45,518
today. So why do all those vehicles look the same? The development of

145
00:08:45,544 --> 00:08:48,914
the Aton incorporates decades of experience in hybrid

146
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:52,514
urban warfare that resulted in the most heavily armored

147
00:08:52,562 --> 00:08:56,642
and technologically advanced wheeled Afe in the world. The Aton

148
00:08:56,706 --> 00:09:01,634
was first announced in 2016, and then it was field tested until 2018.

149
00:09:01,762 --> 00:09:05,498
I noticed something interesting about the interior here, so I had to interrupt myself

150
00:09:05,584 --> 00:09:08,906
real quick. The floorboards on the bottom are much higher than on

151
00:09:08,928 --> 00:09:12,234
the striker that I deployed with. It's clear that Israel has put

152
00:09:12,272 --> 00:09:15,910
a lot of armor on the underbelly underneath the soldier.

153
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,006
Back to you, Chris. It took about five years to develop,

154
00:09:19,108 --> 00:09:22,602
and it was only in 2022 that Israel selected the United

155
00:09:22,676 --> 00:09:26,078
States based Oshkosh Defense to produce the hulls.

156
00:09:26,174 --> 00:09:29,422
These were created at the Merkava factory at Tel

157
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:32,622
Hashmeh in central Israel. Although the production

158
00:09:32,686 --> 00:09:36,994
is an international effort, since over 1 million individual parts

159
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:40,786
need to be manufactured and assembled, and 34 computers

160
00:09:40,818 --> 00:09:43,640
need to be installed for a final product.

161
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,506
Currently, production of the Aton is spread across 60 separate

162
00:09:47,538 --> 00:09:50,906
locations across Israel, so as not to put all their eggs in

163
00:09:50,928 --> 00:09:54,362
one basket. All of its capabilities and design

164
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:58,842
features can be traced directly to problems with the one one three. In 1972,

165
00:09:58,896 --> 00:10:02,846
through a material aid package, the United States donated massive numbers of

166
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:06,414
their old M One one three tracked armored personnel carriers to the

167
00:10:06,452 --> 00:10:09,930
IDF. The Israeli Defense Forces determined that its operational

168
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,370
requirements were not met by the American APC.

169
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,706
This is because the IDF relies on a very aggressive strategy of

170
00:10:16,728 --> 00:10:20,274
maneuver warfare. That means dozens of M One one three s found

171
00:10:20,312 --> 00:10:23,442
themselves decisively engaged against the enemy. Now,

172
00:10:23,496 --> 00:10:27,134
decisively engaged is a military term that means your military

173
00:10:27,182 --> 00:10:30,486
force is fully committed to a battle with the intent of

174
00:10:30,508 --> 00:10:34,162
achieving a decisive outcome or victory. It's the military

175
00:10:34,226 --> 00:10:37,494
version of maximum effort. The problem is the one one three was

176
00:10:37,532 --> 00:10:40,662
really only meant for a support role in the rear and was

177
00:10:40,716 --> 00:10:44,086
often wiped out when it found itself in direct combat. The decision

178
00:10:44,118 --> 00:10:47,398
to develop the Atom was based on one of the lessons learned

179
00:10:47,494 --> 00:10:51,334
from an incident from the invasion of Gaza in Operation Protective

180
00:10:51,382 --> 00:10:54,874
Edge in 2014. At the time, a one one three had a technical

181
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:58,046
error that deadlined it, so it was stuck. Militants took

182
00:10:58,068 --> 00:11:00,682
advantage and fired an RPG at the downed vehicle.

183
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:04,734
Six IDF troops were KIA as a result of the catastrophic

184
00:11:04,782 --> 00:11:08,466
vehicle loss. To remedy this, the IDF began creating a

185
00:11:08,488 --> 00:11:12,146
series of armored personnel carriers, eventually culminating in

186
00:11:12,168 --> 00:11:15,886
the creation of the Namair super Heavy APC. But tracked

187
00:11:15,918 --> 00:11:19,494
vehicles are like getting a degree in interpretive dance. It only

188
00:11:19,532 --> 00:11:23,042
gets you so far in life. While the Namair is a fantastically

189
00:11:23,106 --> 00:11:26,294
protected and capable platform, they're mechanically complex and most

190
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:29,650
importantly, they're slow to deploy. So the IDF started to

191
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,466
evaluate fast moving, quick reaction force vehicles like the

192
00:11:33,488 --> 00:11:37,126
American wheeled striker platform. Israel determined that the striker

193
00:11:37,158 --> 00:11:40,854
was a cheap, knock off, off the shelf solution. The striker

194
00:11:40,902 --> 00:11:44,046
was quickly rejected, with Internet rumors stating that one

195
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:47,546
IDF commander called the thing a piece of junk. Now, as someone who spent

196
00:11:47,578 --> 00:11:50,554
a ton of time on strikers, that hurts.

197
00:11:50,682 --> 00:11:54,506
But he's not wrong. But it still hurts. Even though the increased speed

198
00:11:54,538 --> 00:11:58,254
of the striker was a notable advantage, Israel knew that urban warfare

199
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:02,238
would be their primary concern. The thin skinned armor of the striker

200
00:12:02,334 --> 00:12:06,206
simply would not be enough protection in an aggressive, asymmetric urban

201
00:12:06,238 --> 00:12:09,458
fight. Troop protection has to be the number one priority,

202
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:13,314
even at the cost of other capabilities. Enter the Aton.

203
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:17,346
Initial funding and loose requirements had been established in 2011,

204
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,662
but budgetary restrictions kept development in limbo.

205
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:24,726
Finally, increased funding and personnel was allocated by Israel's

206
00:12:24,758 --> 00:12:28,966
Ministry of Defense. Development of the concept was handed to Raphael advanced

207
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:32,862
defense systems. That's Israel's largest national military R D

208
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:36,366
conglomerate. Raphael would do the developing, while the

209
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:39,882
Tank and APC administration would provide government oversight.

210
00:12:39,946 --> 00:12:43,678
There is one thing that thankfully still has zero government oversight today,

211
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:46,994
and that's whether or not you choose to like this video. That's between you,

212
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:50,626
your family, and your God. The base level armor plating is made

213
00:12:50,648 --> 00:12:54,446
up of ceramic and titanium steel composite, which provides protection

214
00:12:54,478 --> 00:12:57,814
against 14.5 millimeter machine gun fire. Higher up

215
00:12:57,852 --> 00:13:01,074
armor packages stop kinetic penetrator sabo rounds.

216
00:13:01,122 --> 00:13:04,434
It can stop 30 millimeter cannons. More importantly,

217
00:13:04,482 --> 00:13:08,506
though, it can stop dual purpose shape charges from RPG fire

218
00:13:08,608 --> 00:13:12,614
that Hamas really prefers. The armor is classified specifically

219
00:13:12,662 --> 00:13:15,878
as Neera, or non explosive reactive armor.

220
00:13:15,974 --> 00:13:19,654
This means it consists of a combination of three metallic and non metallic

221
00:13:19,702 --> 00:13:23,466
materials. Materials like rubber can diffuse the impact of a shockwave

222
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:27,466
from an explosion. This effectively spreads out the generated force

223
00:13:27,578 --> 00:13:31,322
instead of trying to stop the round entirely. This gives the armor

224
00:13:31,386 --> 00:13:35,326
excellent multi hit capability. This is the Iron Fist active

225
00:13:35,358 --> 00:13:38,894
protection system. This was actually designed by Elbit Systems,

226
00:13:38,942 --> 00:13:43,138
an Israel domestic company, in tandem with the Aeton Armored Project.

227
00:13:43,304 --> 00:13:46,662
It has new capabilities compared to the old trophy system

228
00:13:46,796 --> 00:13:49,682
because the Iron fist, crazy name aside,

229
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,902
contains a more robust and capable radar system that

230
00:13:52,956 --> 00:13:56,614
more accurately detects where, and most importantly, what type of

231
00:13:56,652 --> 00:13:59,914
round was fired at your vehicle. It now has two

232
00:13:59,952 --> 00:14:03,258
launchers and four sensors that are linked to a

233
00:14:03,264 --> 00:14:06,886
radar and electro optics that can even shoot down incoming tank

234
00:14:06,918 --> 00:14:10,730
rounds. The new countermeasure computer solution has an improved 70%

235
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,318
success intercept rate and can even target drones in

236
00:14:14,324 --> 00:14:17,834
the sky now, which is a brand new feature. In total, there's ten cameras

237
00:14:17,882 --> 00:14:21,210
nested around the hull with both day and night sensors.

238
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,862
This gets me especially excited because it means we're just one step away from video

239
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:28,514
game style third person viewing. The Aton is

240
00:14:28,552 --> 00:14:32,926
noticeably larger than older designs like the striker LAV.

241
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:37,246
It's a full two extra feet length and 3ft width.

242
00:14:37,358 --> 00:14:41,106
Much of that increased length comes from the size of its massive armored sponsor

243
00:14:41,138 --> 00:14:44,262
boxes that you can see in the rear of the vehicle. They serve as extra

244
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:47,746
storage space, which is very important, and it serves as kind of like an armored

245
00:14:47,778 --> 00:14:51,426
cover for the troops as they dismount out the back. In our strikers, we couldn't

246
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,938
fit our personal salt packs on the vehicle, inside the vehicle, or on the

247
00:14:54,944 --> 00:14:57,674
roof. So what we would do is we would throw them in the space between

248
00:14:57,712 --> 00:15:00,410
the hull and the armor. On the exterior,

249
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:04,654
it was pretty ghetto. Eight tons also weighed nearly double that

250
00:15:04,692 --> 00:15:08,922
of the American striker counterpart, with base weights of 35 tons.

251
00:15:08,986 --> 00:15:12,126
And it costs roughly $3 million each to produce at

252
00:15:12,148 --> 00:15:15,418
the current rate, about the same as the Namir cousin.

253
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:19,026
Part of this increased cost could, of course, come down to the fact that the

254
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:23,134
scale of which it was ordered. While the Aton is an Israeli homegrown

255
00:15:23,182 --> 00:15:26,494
design, roughly half of its components actually come from foreign

256
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:30,038
sources. This was done in an effort to keep research costs low.

257
00:15:30,124 --> 00:15:33,686
The V shaped hulk can allegedly withstand the blast of over 20 pounds of

258
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:37,350
TNT. It's like 60 sticks of dynamite, and it would create

259
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,026
a crater 10ft big. This hole shape redirects

260
00:15:41,058 --> 00:15:44,474
that blast away from the hull to the sides of the vehicle. And that's why

261
00:15:44,512 --> 00:15:48,806
they've installed the Mobius blast absorbing seats. It's finally morbing

262
00:15:48,838 --> 00:15:52,774
time for real. It cleverly collapses and redirects the soldier's

263
00:15:52,822 --> 00:15:56,666
inertia down as the hole is forced upward from an explosion.

264
00:15:56,698 --> 00:16:00,702
So it can actually navigate 60% vertical slopes and 30%

265
00:16:00,756 --> 00:16:04,878
horizontal slopes. It can even cross a six foot trench or forward up

266
00:16:04,884 --> 00:16:08,398
to 4ft in water. But the big news is that the future models

267
00:16:08,414 --> 00:16:11,854
of the Aton will serve in a more infantry fighting vehicle

268
00:16:11,902 --> 00:16:15,886
role. This version is still being tested, but it's going to have a 30 millimeter.

269
00:16:15,918 --> 00:16:19,758
It's a massive unmanned cannon turret controlled from inside

270
00:16:19,864 --> 00:16:23,154
by the gunner, so it's probably not going to face off against enemy armor.

271
00:16:23,202 --> 00:16:26,742
So why do you need this giant turret? It would be useful for getting

272
00:16:26,796 --> 00:16:30,706
enemy forces out from hiding behind concrete. Actually, three variants

273
00:16:30,738 --> 00:16:33,786
in total are planned for production. You got your standard APC model,

274
00:16:33,888 --> 00:16:37,606
it's lightly armed. You got a command and control model which trades troop

275
00:16:37,638 --> 00:16:40,906
carrying capacity for radio carrying capacity, and you got

276
00:16:40,928 --> 00:16:44,826
your IFV heavily armed turret model. These different versions

277
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:48,298
fit into what's known as the IDF's two war strategy.

278
00:16:48,394 --> 00:16:51,662
The IDF expects to fight one type of war.

279
00:16:51,716 --> 00:16:55,342
That's the conventional border invasions. This would involve crossing

280
00:16:55,406 --> 00:16:59,074
large open terrain against actual enemy armor. This means

281
00:16:59,112 --> 00:17:02,578
you would need larger caliber cannons. Then there's that second war that

282
00:17:02,584 --> 00:17:06,078
they fight. That's the unconventional hybrid urban warfare,

283
00:17:06,174 --> 00:17:10,182
the kind we're seeing in Gaza right now. As international tensions and

284
00:17:10,236 --> 00:17:14,006
conflict began to rise over the past few years, the IDF made

285
00:17:14,028 --> 00:17:17,638
the decision in January of 2023 to outsource the entire

286
00:17:17,724 --> 00:17:21,750
whole production to the United States. The 100 million dollar contract

287
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:24,666
was negotiated by American Oshkosh Defense Company,

288
00:17:24,768 --> 00:17:28,266
which manufactures and produces a number of the military vehicles for

289
00:17:28,288 --> 00:17:31,818
the DoD, such as the new JLTV. This decision was made prior to

290
00:17:31,824 --> 00:17:35,338
the most recent attacks, and this will likely be expediated

291
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:38,666
to quickly replace vehicles lost in the invasion of Gaza.

292
00:17:38,778 --> 00:17:42,190
Overall, the introduction of the Aiton is, and many would agree,

293
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,402
overdue, and brings what was already one of the world's most capable

294
00:17:45,466 --> 00:17:48,894
fighting forces to a level of performance and capability that will fit

295
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:52,654
the strategic needs that they have for decades. For more updates follow
