1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,270
I went undercover for 24 hours to try and make as much money as possible

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:08,234
just by editing. I created fake profiles on the most popular

3
00:00:08,282 --> 00:00:12,142
websites for finding editing jobs, all in an attempt to prove that

4
00:00:12,196 --> 00:00:15,594
anyone, no matter who you are, can make money editing.

5
00:00:15,722 --> 00:00:19,406
How much, though? I'll let you find out. Yeah. Damn, dude, I just

6
00:00:19,428 --> 00:00:25,280
got paid. I just wrote. Yeah, like you.

7
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,534
It's time to go. Let's do this. First thing I'm going to do is start

8
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:33,586
up a new account on Discord. Discord is one of the platforms

9
00:00:33,618 --> 00:00:35,638
that we're going to be using a lot of because I know that there are

10
00:00:35,644 --> 00:00:39,686
a lot of editing servers that offer jobs. So let's make an account on

11
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:43,446
Discord. This meant logging out of my Finzar account and beginning the brainstorming

12
00:00:43,478 --> 00:00:46,794
process for a new username. I wanted to go for something that was unique enough

13
00:00:46,832 --> 00:00:50,006
to catch an eye, but also generic enough to seem trustworthy,

14
00:00:50,038 --> 00:00:53,294
which is a tough balance to create with just a name. Now, I'd thought about

15
00:00:53,332 --> 00:00:57,098
many names, but only one stood out to me. One that was still boring,

16
00:00:57,194 --> 00:01:00,330
but kept catching my eye. Darren.

17
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:04,742
Now all I had to do was create his last bopper.

18
00:01:04,906 --> 00:01:07,490
No, no, it's gotta be professional. Darren.

19
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:13,810
Darren.

20
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,082
What's like a cool job? What's like a cool job? That, like a blacksmith.

21
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:23,778
Darren Smith. Smith. Darren Smith. With Darren Smith

22
00:01:23,794 --> 00:01:27,410
as my new alias, I now had to brand this new metahuman

23
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:30,914
and give him a face. And believe me, ladies and fins, in the early stages

24
00:01:30,962 --> 00:01:34,474
of selling Darren as an editor, a lot of the success will come down to

25
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:38,026
the way I do this branding. So I went into Photoshop, where I

26
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:41,318
then used the new generative fill AI feature to create a

27
00:01:41,344 --> 00:01:42,990
face for Darren Smith.

28
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,782
Look at this guy. This is a really important step.

29
00:01:48,836 --> 00:01:52,110
We need to make it look like he's a real person and not like a

30
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,220
stock image. I don't know, man. Like, who is that? Oh,

31
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,286
that is up. Oh, no, I can't say that. And after a couple minutes skimming

32
00:02:00,318 --> 00:02:03,806
through options, I finally found him. That is Darren

33
00:02:03,838 --> 00:02:07,454
Smith. And with Darren Smith created, I then went on to make him a discord

34
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,886
profile. He needed some meat on his skinny little bones, and what better

35
00:02:10,908 --> 00:02:13,766
way to do that than to make him a show reel? Something to show off

36
00:02:13,788 --> 00:02:17,766
his editing skills and catch the attention of some clients. Looking pretty good for

37
00:02:17,788 --> 00:02:21,494
time, I jumped into Premiere Pro and began making the show reel using

38
00:02:21,532 --> 00:02:25,318
my animation preset pack. Baby. They come with these PNG images, which I'm

39
00:02:25,334 --> 00:02:28,522
going to animate quickly. I'm just going to literally just use my preset pack.

40
00:02:28,576 --> 00:02:32,426
This whole pack is actually dedicated to animating PNGs like this. Doing this

41
00:02:32,448 --> 00:02:35,534
kind of thing is actually very desirable on YouTube, and I'm hoping that someone will

42
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,878
see this and think, I want that done. I've been looking for

43
00:02:38,884 --> 00:02:42,202
someone to do this for my videos for ages, so I think it's pretty desirable.

44
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:45,806
And after only 15 minutes of editing, I had finished the animations that

45
00:02:45,828 --> 00:02:48,398
I wanted to put in the show reel, and this is what they look like.

46
00:02:48,484 --> 00:02:52,046
Wa There is a reason that

47
00:02:52,068 --> 00:02:54,746
I'm going to spend a while doing this, and it's because this really matters.

48
00:02:54,778 --> 00:02:57,894
When it comes to showcasing your work and getting a job. People want to see

49
00:02:57,932 --> 00:03:00,054
that you can do audio well. People want to see that you can do their

50
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:03,446
transitions well. It's all about making people feel like they can just totally trust you

51
00:03:03,468 --> 00:03:06,690
and what you're doing. And after 1 hour and 40 minutes of editing,

52
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,538
I had completed the animations, transitions,

53
00:03:09,634 --> 00:03:13,686
subtitles, and audio design, and it was looking good using my nice transitions

54
00:03:13,718 --> 00:03:17,114
pack. It's pretty cool. Man, that did not look good. Oh, and I did

55
00:03:17,152 --> 00:03:20,742
use voiceover for this show reel, which I feel gives it some more personality

56
00:03:20,806 --> 00:03:23,722
and trustworthiness. And thank you to my cameraman for doing that,

57
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:27,754
even if he sounded a little bit like a robot. Hi, guys. My name's Darren

58
00:03:27,802 --> 00:03:31,386
Smith, and this is my show reel. These are some of the transitions

59
00:03:31,418 --> 00:03:35,022
that I could do for you. With the show reel complete and with 2 hours

60
00:03:35,076 --> 00:03:39,026
eaten away, it was time to upload my material and begin spreading myself around like

61
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:42,386
the bubonic plague. That's right, baby. I was going low to

62
00:03:42,408 --> 00:03:45,870
the far depths of low. The lowest I'd ever gone. I was dming

63
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:49,222
every single person, posting jobs that I could see. Not only that,

64
00:03:49,276 --> 00:03:52,902
but copy and pasting the same message to every single one. No wonder

65
00:03:52,956 --> 00:03:56,086
this happened. I want to look for more jobs, but the

66
00:03:56,108 --> 00:03:59,906
thing is, Discord is limiting me from applying to jobs because I haven't

67
00:03:59,938 --> 00:04:03,418
had an account for over a day, so it's slowing down every single DM I

68
00:04:03,424 --> 00:04:06,822
sent. So with my spamming on Discord, I had been stopped in my tracks.

69
00:04:06,886 --> 00:04:09,878
I also set up a quick Twitter account to search for jobs, but also ended

70
00:04:09,894 --> 00:04:13,098
up hitting the same obstacle there. It turned out that being too keen of

71
00:04:13,104 --> 00:04:16,286
an editor on the first day was a bad thing. So all I could do

72
00:04:16,308 --> 00:04:19,294
now was wait for something to come back to me.

73
00:04:19,412 --> 00:04:22,894
And at 525 3 hours and 25 minutes into

74
00:04:22,932 --> 00:04:26,206
my time doing this challenge, I received the first promising message of the

75
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:29,298
day. Yo, yo. Someone might be one of them. To say I was excited would

76
00:04:29,304 --> 00:04:33,042
be an understatement. Hello, beautiful editing. It's nice to meet you. I know.

77
00:04:33,096 --> 00:04:35,778
I mean, no. Oh my God. Hey,

78
00:04:35,864 --> 00:04:39,374
thanks so much. Nice to meet you.

79
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:42,118
Play cool. Play cool. Play cool. We might have a job. We might have a

80
00:04:42,124 --> 00:04:44,978
job. Maybe. This is actually quite exciting. My morale.

81
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:48,582
Morale. Bump it up. I myself edit as well.

82
00:04:48,636 --> 00:04:52,198
I just can't really find much motivational time to do it. And since I'm

83
00:04:52,214 --> 00:04:56,026
distracted and supposed to be editing right now, I'm on Discord. And after even that

84
00:04:56,048 --> 00:04:59,820
little bit of chat, I was suddenly skeptical. Where's this going?

85
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,882
Maybe they just want a little chitchat. So instead of wasting time, I asked

86
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:07,006
for work. And while I waited for a response, I checked out the channel to

87
00:05:07,028 --> 00:05:10,142
see what I might be up against. Let's watch one of his videos. Whatever color

88
00:05:10,196 --> 00:05:13,934
I spin, be void. Whoever touches the forbidden color,

89
00:05:13,972 --> 00:05:17,666
which is the videos on his channel, were roughly 15 to 20 minutes each with

90
00:05:17,688 --> 00:05:20,846
moderate editing, including subtitles, zooms,

91
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:24,706
memes, meme sound effects, and slide transitions. Now, all that,

92
00:05:24,728 --> 00:05:28,226
for me, is actually fine. As an experienced editor, I know that the most

93
00:05:28,248 --> 00:05:31,894
grueling part of editing is cutting up and pacing the video, which takes

94
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:35,462
the longest to do and requires the most motivation. This kid wants me to finish

95
00:05:35,516 --> 00:05:39,270
all of that shit. And so, feeling like a 20 minutes video

96
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,326
with all of that editing might be a bit too much of a task to

97
00:05:42,348 --> 00:05:45,834
take on. With only 20 hours left, I decided to look around some more

98
00:05:45,872 --> 00:05:49,114
and see my other options. And whilst I was looking, I received quite a few

99
00:05:49,152 --> 00:05:52,746
more messages from this guy Ori. And at this point, just kind of seemed like

100
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:55,882
maybe he wanted to chat. He's just having a chat. And Darren, being the gruff

101
00:05:55,946 --> 00:05:59,598
editor that he is, has no time to waste. So amidst the

102
00:05:59,604 --> 00:06:03,482
chitchat, I ask him how much he'll pay. His answer is, first, a bit confusing,

103
00:06:03,546 --> 00:06:07,242
but promising nonetheless. He's willing to pay $30 to $35

104
00:06:07,316 --> 00:06:10,498
per hour of work. Now, to me, that's a really good deal.

105
00:06:10,664 --> 00:06:14,018
But there is that part in my brain which actually thinks that he's willing to

106
00:06:14,024 --> 00:06:17,554
pay that much per hour of footage, which, if it's a 20

107
00:06:17,592 --> 00:06:21,014
minutes video, would only give me $10. And that's not good enough.

108
00:06:21,052 --> 00:06:24,582
It's nearly 06:00, which means that we've been editing for almost

109
00:06:24,636 --> 00:06:28,178
4 hours straight. So now I'm just going to let this breathe for a minute.

110
00:06:28,194 --> 00:06:31,386
Because I've been applying for a lot of jobs. Hopefully we're going to get at

111
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:35,290
least one response whilst we're away. And then prepare for another 20

112
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,362
hours of this. All right.

113
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:41,114
While Finn searches for a job. I'm going to go get us some pizza.

114
00:06:41,162 --> 00:06:44,526
And I guess I'm paying for it because Finn can't afford anything right

115
00:06:44,548 --> 00:06:46,640
now. Because he still hasn't made any money.

116
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,206
Hang on. Thanks, cameraman. Let's hope

117
00:06:52,228 --> 00:06:55,140
that discord has got some treats for us when we get back.

118
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,954
We got nothing. We didn't get any messages back.

119
00:07:01,992 --> 00:07:05,118
And so it begins. I accepted the job with Ori and downloaded

120
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:09,350
the files immediately. First job on the DL download

121
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,686
time was 717. And Darren was roughly 5 hours into

122
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:17,014
his editing challenge. Ori has sent his footage. And I finally had something

123
00:07:17,052 --> 00:07:20,626
to dig my editing teeth into. Having received a few notes from Ori

124
00:07:20,658 --> 00:07:24,026
and a snippet of the editing style he wanted. I got on with cutting up

125
00:07:24,048 --> 00:07:27,334
the raw footage. Now, as I kind of pre warned you earlier.

126
00:07:27,382 --> 00:07:30,806
I know that the most grueling part of editing is cutting up and pasting

127
00:07:30,838 --> 00:07:34,074
the video. Cutting up that raw footage is the most boring part of the whole

128
00:07:34,112 --> 00:07:37,566
Process and the most time consuming. So let me make this a little bit more

129
00:07:37,588 --> 00:07:40,926
fun for you to watch and summarize the next 14 hours for you nice and

130
00:07:40,948 --> 00:07:44,574
quick with a list of the major things that happened. 753 I

131
00:07:44,612 --> 00:07:48,046
received an exciting message request. Hey Darren. I've come across some of your work

132
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,546
and thought it was really good. Definitely do with your skill set on team.

133
00:07:50,568 --> 00:07:53,470
Let me know. Thank you. Which then turned out to be a complete dud.

134
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,090
836 Ori requests to see progress clips.

135
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:01,030
840 Give me some chocolate. My cameraman fed me chocolate.

136
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:07,586
918 Ori prods me again for clips.

137
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,600
927 I went for a quick walk.

138
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,850
1015 Darren gets his first subscriber on YouTube.

139
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,040
And we made the mistake of looking at the subscribers channel.

140
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,740
You want to see it done. But you got to give Darren time.

141
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:45,758
Okay. 1138 and I shit you not. Ore has asked for another preview.

142
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:49,762
Yep. I think I'm going to ignore this. 111 48 Master

143
00:08:49,826 --> 00:08:53,122
Chief steps in. What do I do? Chief Finzar.

144
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:57,126
You are editing really well. Do not give up. But also your

145
00:08:57,148 --> 00:09:00,198
ass stinks. Wait. What? Your butt. It stinks. What do

146
00:09:00,204 --> 00:09:02,746
you mean? You need to hurry up and edit. That's what I'm. You need to

147
00:09:02,768 --> 00:09:06,086
do it faster. That's what I'm doing. I'm getting bored. Edit faster.

148
00:09:06,118 --> 00:09:09,226
Finn. But how? Fine. Put me on your head and

149
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:12,798
he'll show you. Okay? All right. But I don't know if I'm going to be

150
00:09:12,804 --> 00:09:15,854
able to see that well out of. Just shut up and put me on already.

151
00:09:16,052 --> 00:09:17,920
He's a little bit rude, but here we go.

152
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:21,710
Ow.

153
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:30,366
1228 I finished cutting up the project and start adding zooms.

154
00:09:30,398 --> 00:09:33,666
I finished cutting up the project. Now I'm going to add zooms for

155
00:09:33,688 --> 00:09:35,060
the whole 15 minutes.

156
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,406
1230. My cameraman goes to bed. Good night.

157
00:09:40,428 --> 00:09:43,330
Cameraman. You go to bed. You go sleep well. Okay? And I'm all alone.

158
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,360
I'll be okay.

159
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,946
For the next 2 hours, I edited nonstop until the zooms

160
00:09:50,978 --> 00:09:54,746
were done. And I was happy with the pacing. And at 230, I stopped for

161
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:58,054
the night. It's 238. It's time for me to retire. I'm tired.

162
00:09:58,102 --> 00:10:01,902
Look at that. Yeah. I got to go to sleep now and

163
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:05,214
actually save myself so that I can work well tomorrow. Right?

164
00:10:05,332 --> 00:10:06,160
Good night.

165
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:12,986
For 5 hours, I slept as good as humanly possible. A blEssing,

166
00:10:13,018 --> 00:10:16,110
really, but also a curse. Think I might have overslept.

167
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,586
Yep. Indeed I did. So I hurried myself up and got straight back

168
00:10:19,608 --> 00:10:23,234
into the office. No breakfast, no shower, nothing.

169
00:10:23,432 --> 00:10:26,558
Pretty grim stuff, guys. My cameraman

170
00:10:26,574 --> 00:10:30,040
arose too, and within ten minutes of waking up, I was off again.

171
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,518
I hate to be this guy, man. Hate, hate to be that guy. Bunny a

172
00:10:34,524 --> 00:10:37,080
cough. I go where I'm making the money here.

173
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:43,446
I began with sound effects, which was as simple as doing all of the transitions

174
00:10:43,478 --> 00:10:47,590
with whooshes, highlighting funny character moments with cartoon sound effects

175
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:51,194
and a few too many bras. Bra. I don't know why, I just

176
00:10:51,232 --> 00:10:54,606
thought it was Wieners. Bra. 1030 by this point, I'd been

177
00:10:54,628 --> 00:10:58,266
roughly editing for 14 hours straight, minus sleep

178
00:10:58,298 --> 00:11:01,834
and breaks. The thought of seeing the finish line at this point felt extremely

179
00:11:01,882 --> 00:11:05,374
motivational to me. But even still, with over 3 hours left,

180
00:11:05,412 --> 00:11:08,722
I was struggling. I had to channel the inner editing Beast and Power

181
00:11:08,776 --> 00:11:12,226
on. Got to keep going. There is absolutely no way that I'm coming out of

182
00:11:12,248 --> 00:11:15,954
this with no cash. Even if it's less than I hope for. I have to

183
00:11:15,992 --> 00:11:19,742
finish this project. 1138. I started the subtitles.

184
00:11:19,806 --> 00:11:22,934
Luckily, I wouldn't have to do much as the intro has already been edited by

185
00:11:22,972 --> 00:11:26,278
Ori, which is where the main bulk of subtitles would be needed. All I

186
00:11:26,284 --> 00:11:29,174
had to do was cover up the bits that were unintelligible and where it's most

187
00:11:29,212 --> 00:11:33,366
comedic. You have to. For the next 2 hours. I polished,

188
00:11:33,478 --> 00:11:37,178
scrubbed, wiped, and cleaned up that timeline like never before.

189
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:40,554
It was like that Disney movie Soul Darren had completely taken over

190
00:11:40,592 --> 00:11:44,506
me and I was in the zone. As the time came

191
00:11:44,528 --> 00:11:47,886
to an end, I managed to finish the video within half an hour of the

192
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:51,358
time limit. Okay, video is finished, and we got half an

193
00:11:51,364 --> 00:11:54,846
hour left. I got to actually start rendering, otherwise I might miss it. I slapped

194
00:11:54,878 --> 00:11:58,322
it on Render as soon as I could, and now all I could do was

195
00:11:58,376 --> 00:11:58,980
wait.

196
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:06,866
Rendered. With the video rendered quickly, I uploaded it onto Google Drive to

197
00:12:06,888 --> 00:12:10,262
center. Ori, look at the time limit. We got 32 minutes left.

198
00:12:10,316 --> 00:12:13,814
You can't make that up. You cannot make that up. All right. I think by

199
00:12:13,852 --> 00:12:17,174
this standard, we're going to hit it just in

200
00:12:17,212 --> 00:12:20,902
time. And with the video uploading, just with enough time to make it, Ori finally

201
00:12:20,956 --> 00:12:23,466
gave me a solid answer on how much he was going to pay me.

202
00:12:23,488 --> 00:12:26,634
He wants to pay me $33. This challenge isn't over

203
00:12:26,672 --> 00:12:30,310
just yet. I think he means per hour of footage,

204
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:33,614
which is annoying. Essentially, Ori had planned to pay me for

205
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:36,160
every hour of footage that he sent me.

206
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,782
He sent me about 50 minutes worth of footage, so in his eyes,

207
00:12:40,836 --> 00:12:44,398
it was worth $30. But Darren isn't going to give up that easy.

208
00:12:44,484 --> 00:12:48,050
I pushed for a better price, and I got $50 for the whole thing.

209
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,274
It wasn't much of a bump, but it was something. $50 for 9

210
00:12:52,312 --> 00:12:55,650
hours of work? Nine and a half. 50 divided by 9.5.

211
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,246
About $6 an hour. It's not as good as $30 an hour, but it's

212
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,214
something. This is just the reality of editing. When you start up on the first

213
00:13:02,252 --> 00:13:05,542
day, I mean, I wasn't expecting to find a $500 job.

214
00:13:05,596 --> 00:13:09,046
It's just how it be. If I was Darren Smith and

215
00:13:09,228 --> 00:13:13,018
I hadn't started a YouTube channel, I haven't done anything. I had zero

216
00:13:13,104 --> 00:13:17,020
experience, and I just got $50 for, like, 9 hours of work.

217
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,986
It's not great. I don't know, man. It's $50. I can't be unhappy with $50.

218
00:13:23,008 --> 00:13:26,378
It pays for the pizza. Pays for the pizza and the Discord membership.

219
00:13:26,474 --> 00:13:29,774
And we got, like, a little bit of spending money left over. The tiniest bit.

220
00:13:29,812 --> 00:13:32,958
And with that wrapped up, the upload to drive had finished. Time to send it

221
00:13:32,964 --> 00:13:37,182
to Ori, and by 02:00 exactly, I'd completed the challenge.

222
00:13:37,326 --> 00:13:41,054
The timing really was immaculate, and we managed to just about squeeze

223
00:13:41,102 --> 00:13:44,658
everything into the 24 hours. But what's even stranger is that

224
00:13:44,664 --> 00:13:48,274
I got paid exactly at 02:00. $51 from

225
00:13:48,312 --> 00:13:50,790
Ori. I just got paid at 02:00.

226
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,514
Honestly, I don't think you could get a better ending than that. Damn, dude,

227
00:13:54,562 --> 00:13:58,214
I just got paid. Are you getting. Tell him your fins are. Yeah, we got

228
00:13:58,252 --> 00:14:00,920
paid. Let's go spend this money.

229
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:07,574
I don't know on what, though. Will he, A, buy another pizza, B,

230
00:14:07,612 --> 00:14:10,846
buy a medieval foam sword, or C, match the monies that you made on this

231
00:14:10,868 --> 00:14:12,590
challenge and donate that to charity.

232
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,800
Get out of here. Go away now.

233
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,830
Bye. Shake just a little bit faster.

234
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,670
No competitIon.

235
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,890
Shake just a little bit faster.
