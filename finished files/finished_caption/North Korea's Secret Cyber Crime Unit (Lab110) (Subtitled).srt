00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,166
You. On 13 August 2016,

2
00:00:03,188 --> 00:00:06,654
a mysterious auction appeared on the web,

3
00:00:06,772 --> 00:00:09,950
claiming that anyone who wanted could purchase national level

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,126
cybersecurity weapons that had been produced by none other than the American

5
00:00:14,228 --> 00:00:17,802
NSA and specifically an elite hacking unit

6
00:00:17,866 --> 00:00:21,626
known as the equation Group. However, the auction's

7
00:00:21,658 --> 00:00:25,682
rules were so strange that nobody wanted to bid. The sellers,

8
00:00:25,746 --> 00:00:29,526
who called themselves the Shadow Brokers, only attached a

9
00:00:29,548 --> 00:00:33,046
bitcoin wallet address and stated that everyone who lost the

10
00:00:33,068 --> 00:00:36,674
auction wouldn't get their money back. Because of these strange

11
00:00:36,722 --> 00:00:40,486
rules and the password protected files, the biggest bid

12
00:00:40,518 --> 00:00:43,942
was only about $9,000. The mysterious

13
00:00:44,006 --> 00:00:47,942
auction was a complete failure. However, these mysterious

14
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:51,582
files wouldn't just disappear from the web. But before

15
00:00:51,636 --> 00:00:55,162
we continue, I'd like to introduce you to today's sponsor,

16
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:59,438
Proton. Your email provider knows all about

17
00:00:59,524 --> 00:01:02,898
you. Your name, birthday, address,

18
00:01:02,984 --> 00:01:06,834
phone number, workplace things you purchased, trips you went

19
00:01:06,872 --> 00:01:10,338
on, your passport copy. That's your data,

20
00:01:10,424 --> 00:01:14,622
right? Wrong. That data is being sold to advertisers.

21
00:01:14,686 --> 00:01:18,166
The more data you give away, the more valuable you are.

22
00:01:18,268 --> 00:01:21,554
Like a product. Then they profile you and target

23
00:01:21,602 --> 00:01:24,710
you with ads. What could possibly go wrong?

24
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,306
In 2016, Yahoo confirmed that emails

25
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:32,090
of all 3 billion users were leaked. Everyone's data

26
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,402
was up for grabs and could be used for identity theft and

27
00:01:35,456 --> 00:01:38,922
fraud. You don't want your life details to be in the hands

28
00:01:38,976 --> 00:01:42,366
of advertisers or hackers. So what can you do?

29
00:01:42,468 --> 00:01:46,026

42
00:02:31,732 --> 00:02:34,974
let's get back to the video. A group calling themselves the

43
00:02:35,012 --> 00:02:37,770
Shadow brokers claim that they've hacked the NSA.

44
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:41,434
Mysteriously, a cache of NSA hacking

45
00:02:41,482 --> 00:02:45,530
tools was released online. The Shadow brokers

46
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:49,442
sparked fears of a new group of previously unknown zero day

47
00:02:49,496 --> 00:02:52,962
exploits. We were trying to answer essentially one big

48
00:02:53,016 --> 00:02:57,122
question. How could a group since August of 2016

49
00:02:57,266 --> 00:03:01,126
offer for sale samples of what clearly was

50
00:03:01,228 --> 00:03:05,222
code used inside the National Security Agency to

51
00:03:05,276 --> 00:03:08,842
break into foreign computer systems? The NSA and FBI have taken

52
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:12,426
this breach extremely seriously. But their inability to actually

53
00:03:12,528 --> 00:03:15,370
find the root cause is deeply problematic.

54
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,960
It's the middle of the night when one of the employees of Telephonica

55
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,704
notices something weird on his computer screen. He quickly grabs

56
00:03:27,752 --> 00:03:30,444
his phone and dials his supervisor. Hey,

57
00:03:30,482 --> 00:03:33,816
Juan, we've got a massive problem. Minutes later,

58
00:03:33,938 --> 00:03:38,076
a nurse working for the United Kingdom's National Health Services reported

59
00:03:38,108 --> 00:03:42,172
that her computer stopped working, a major cyberattack

60
00:03:42,236 --> 00:03:46,600
forcing hospitals across the UK to turn away patients.

61
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,088
Ambulances were diverted to other hospitals. Operations canceled

62
00:03:51,184 --> 00:03:55,140
as malicious software paralyzed 16 hospital computer

63
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:59,284
systems across England. Heart patient Anthony Bret was

64
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:03,124
told his operation was on hold. I was supposed to have a stent

65
00:04:03,172 --> 00:04:06,824
put in over the weekend. I can't do it now because

66
00:04:06,862 --> 00:04:10,884
of all this computer egging. But this was only the beginning.

67
00:04:11,012 --> 00:04:14,616
A massive cyber hack hits countries around the world, crippling tens

68
00:04:14,648 --> 00:04:18,140
of thousands of computers. On Friday, the so called ransomware attack

69
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:21,404
locks people out of their computers and demands money.

70
00:04:21,522 --> 00:04:24,716
Experts are calling the WannaCry virus the

71
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:28,636
largest cyberattack in history. This virus has impacted Germany's

72
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,920
national rail system as well as FedEx. Here in the United States,

73
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:36,076
at least five Australian businesses have been hit. Today, we learned of an auto assembly

74
00:04:36,108 --> 00:04:39,408
line suddenly stopped because computers had shut down. South Korea

75
00:04:39,424 --> 00:04:43,204
is among the 150 countries that have been affected by

76
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:47,188
Friday's unprecedented malware attack, which has

77
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:50,972
infected more than 200,000 computers worldwide.

78
00:04:51,056 --> 00:04:54,516
The attack used a loophole exposed when stolen NSA

79
00:04:54,548 --> 00:04:57,800
documents were posted online with that information.

80
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,176
Any idea who is behind the attack? I don't think we

81
00:05:01,198 --> 00:05:02,990
have any real idea of that.

82
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,056
As the mysterious ransomware was wrecking havoc on the global

83
00:05:10,088 --> 00:05:13,800
economy, a cybersecurity expert called Marcus Hutchins

84
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,516
decided to jump into the action and analyze the virus.

85
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:21,072
As he roamed through the malware's code, he discovered that

86
00:05:21,126 --> 00:05:24,960
before the malware began its encryption process, it tried to connect

87
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,752
to a strange URL. However, this connection

88
00:05:28,816 --> 00:05:31,844
failed every time, and once it didn't connect,

89
00:05:31,962 --> 00:05:35,488
the virus began to encrypt the infected system. It turned

90
00:05:35,504 --> 00:05:38,816
out that this URL was an unregistered domain.

91
00:05:38,928 --> 00:05:43,092
Curious about the reason for this URL's existence, Hutchins decided

92
00:05:43,156 --> 00:05:46,660
to risk it all by buying and registering the domain.

93
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,420
The ransomware that affected 99 countries and an estimated

94
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,892
75,000 individual computers was stopped

95
00:05:53,956 --> 00:05:57,324
in its tracks by accident. He actually probably saved lives on

96
00:05:57,362 --> 00:06:00,876
accident just by registering this one website name in

97
00:06:00,898 --> 00:06:04,328
his name. I've had people sort of inundating me messages thanking me, saying that I'm

98
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:07,468
a hero. I mean, I sort of just registered this domain for tracking. And I

99
00:06:07,474 --> 00:06:10,896
didn't intend for it to sort of blow up and me to be all over

100
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:13,664
the media. I was just sort of doing my job, and I don't really think

101
00:06:13,702 --> 00:06:15,090
that I'm a hero at all.

102
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:22,326
It turns out that WannaCry was a complex worm that had been

103
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:25,634
inserted into the digital world with only one objective,

104
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:29,842
to hunt for vulnerable SMB ports. An SMB

105
00:06:29,906 --> 00:06:33,258
port is basically a protocol that every Microsoft computer

106
00:06:33,344 --> 00:06:36,874
uses to send information packs from computers to printers or

107
00:06:36,912 --> 00:06:40,714
other machines connected on a network. And since this information is

108
00:06:40,752 --> 00:06:44,494
always moving around, the worm could access this flow of information

109
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,946
and then insert itself into the communication protocol.

110
00:06:48,138 --> 00:06:51,674
Once inside, the worm was able to use the communication

111
00:06:51,722 --> 00:06:55,338
protocol's data traffic to infect the first machine.

112
00:06:55,514 --> 00:06:58,914
AfteR infiltrating the machine, it created a backdoor to

113
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:02,802
execute its malware and replicated itself. These new

114
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:06,206
copies would go on to infect the network the machine was connected

115
00:07:06,238 --> 00:07:09,294
to in order to search for more vulnerable machines.

116
00:07:09,422 --> 00:07:12,822
And because big businesses usually have a network in which

117
00:07:12,876 --> 00:07:16,806
every machine is connected, it was able to quickly infect everything

118
00:07:16,908 --> 00:07:20,086
in their networks. The two main tools used by

119
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:23,346
the worm were eternal blue and double pulsar,

120
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:26,730
which had been developed by the NSA and were in fact

121
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,074
some of the exploits that had been leaked by the Shadow brokers a few

122
00:07:30,112 --> 00:07:34,074
weeks earlier. However, inside of this complex mesh of

123
00:07:34,112 --> 00:07:38,262
code, researchers working for the FBI also discovered several

124
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:41,806
notes which often contained data about the computer that

125
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:45,594
created them. By using this data, they found that the original

126
00:07:45,642 --> 00:07:49,274
computer contained the file FCharset

127
00:07:49,322 --> 00:07:53,406
129, which is the file name for the Korean alphabet.

128
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,246
Furthermore, the time zone set for the hackers computers

129
00:07:57,278 --> 00:08:00,882
was UTC plus 9 hours, which is the time zone

130
00:08:00,946 --> 00:08:04,246
used in Korea. Everything seemed to point to the

131
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:07,686
Korean Peninsula, and since South Korea is a close U.

132
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,914
S. Ally, suspicions quickly fell upon North

133
00:08:10,962 --> 00:08:14,166
Korea. Traces of the attack were connected to a person who

134
00:08:14,188 --> 00:08:17,638
went by Kim Hyo Wu. And surprisingly,

135
00:08:17,734 --> 00:08:20,966
all of his digital footprints pointed towards the Chinese town

136
00:08:20,998 --> 00:08:24,654
of Dalyan. And as the team continued to stitch together the different

137
00:08:24,692 --> 00:08:27,994
pieces of evidence, they slowly revealed the true scope

138
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:29,390
of Kim's activity.

139
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,164
He wasn't only connected to the origins of WannaCry,

140
00:08:36,292 --> 00:08:40,264
but also played a major role in the 2014 Sony

141
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:43,464
attack, the 2016 Bangladeshi bank

142
00:08:43,512 --> 00:08:47,656
heist, and even attacks on the US weapons manufacturer Lockheed

143
00:08:47,688 --> 00:08:51,024
Martin. Whoever Keem was, he was part

144
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:54,204
of a massive web of devastating cyberattacks.

145
00:08:54,332 --> 00:08:56,400
But he was a complete mystery.

146
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,264
However, one night, one of the FBI researchers found

147
00:09:01,302 --> 00:09:04,996
an email that would change everything. This email

148
00:09:05,098 --> 00:09:08,704
didn't belong to Keem, but to a gaming developer called Pak

149
00:09:08,752 --> 00:09:12,912
Jin yuk, who had uploaded a zip file containing malicious files

150
00:09:12,976 --> 00:09:16,708
and granted shared access to several of Keem's emails.

151
00:09:16,804 --> 00:09:20,296
The connections finally culminated when they discovered that PAc was

152
00:09:20,318 --> 00:09:24,116
in Dalyan at the same time Kim was perpetrating his attacks.

153
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:27,596
From there, the FBI concluded that Keem was in

154
00:09:27,618 --> 00:09:30,888
fact PAC's online persona, and as the authorities

155
00:09:30,984 --> 00:09:34,136
slowly located the precise location of his activities,

156
00:09:34,248 --> 00:09:37,996
they all pointed to the same place, a gaming company

157
00:09:38,098 --> 00:09:42,300
known as Chosen Expo. The authorities quickly investigated

158
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,856
Chosen Expo, and to their surprise, they had contracted with

159
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:49,516
a gaming developer who was none other than Pac Jin Yuk.

160
00:09:49,628 --> 00:09:52,744
Furthermore, he specialized in the programming language

161
00:09:52,812 --> 00:09:56,036
Visual C, the language used to

162
00:09:56,058 --> 00:09:59,584
create the WannaCry malware. Chosen Expo's accounts

163
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:03,332
would quickly enter the picture. When the investigators found that not only

164
00:10:03,386 --> 00:10:06,656
were pox'accounts connected to cybercrime, but that most

165
00:10:06,698 --> 00:10:10,660
of the company's accounts were being used to carry out cyber attacks,

166
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,292
the entire company seemed to be a front for some unknown

167
00:10:14,356 --> 00:10:17,876
elite cybercrime group, and as the investigations into

168
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:21,676
Chosen Expo continued, it allowed investigators to finally put

169
00:10:21,698 --> 00:10:24,892
the pieces of the puzzle together. The group

170
00:10:24,946 --> 00:10:28,904
that operated from Chosen Expo would be identified as North Korea's

171
00:10:28,952 --> 00:10:32,876
top hacking department, called Lab 110, a secretive

172
00:10:32,908 --> 00:10:37,072
group whose members or front companies had never been revealed before.

173
00:10:37,206 --> 00:10:40,636
But it seemed that Lab 100 and ten's main operations in Chosen

174
00:10:40,668 --> 00:10:44,156
Expo had concluded around 2014, when Pock

175
00:10:44,188 --> 00:10:48,112
and several others traveled back to North Korea. Even Stranger

176
00:10:48,176 --> 00:10:51,332
is that pock and his team hadn't been seen since then,

177
00:10:51,386 --> 00:10:55,104
and most likely had been sent on another top secret mission with new

178
00:10:55,162 --> 00:10:58,920
identities. Nonetheless, the discovery of Lab 110

179
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,312
was a major win for the international cybercrime community,

180
00:11:02,446 --> 00:11:06,564
who finally got insights into North Korean cybercrime activity.

181
00:11:06,692 --> 00:11:10,332
But almost nothing is known about them, since they are in fact,

182
00:11:10,386 --> 00:11:13,948
a top secret department of a highly paranoid country.

183
00:11:14,114 --> 00:11:17,464
This is because their operations are known only by a handful

184
00:11:17,512 --> 00:11:21,484
of people, mainly the group itself and the leadership of Bureau

185
00:11:21,532 --> 00:11:25,084
121, the faction that oversees North Korea's

186
00:11:25,132 --> 00:11:28,448
special hacking operations. In addition to this,

187
00:11:28,534 --> 00:11:32,124
they have an extremely harsh selection process that was revealed

188
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:36,292
by a North Korean defector in 2013. Bureau 121

189
00:11:36,346 --> 00:11:40,224
is always searching for young children that display extraordinary talent

190
00:11:40,272 --> 00:11:43,744
in math, and once they find them, they send them to the Kim

191
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:46,852
Ilsung University and Kim Czech universities

192
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:50,356
of Technology, where they learn everything about hacking.

193
00:11:50,468 --> 00:11:53,416
But this is only the first step in their education.

194
00:11:53,598 --> 00:11:57,016
Every year, the ten best students are enlisted in a

195
00:11:57,038 --> 00:12:00,268
top secret education program that sends them to a special

196
00:12:00,354 --> 00:12:04,568
university in India to become lethal cyber soldiers.

197
00:12:04,744 --> 00:12:08,552
After years of training, only the best of the best get recruited

198
00:12:08,616 --> 00:12:11,724
by Bureau 121. Which then gives them

199
00:12:11,762 --> 00:12:15,020
new identities and designates them to specific teams,

200
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,480
such as Lab 110. Once they're assigned to their team,

201
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:22,144
they are given contracts in secret North Korean front companies

202
00:12:22,262 --> 00:12:26,272
all around the world. Several of these fronts have been identified

203
00:12:26,336 --> 00:12:30,240
in Chinese border towns, but others have been located in Belarus,

204
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,876
Malaysia, India, and Russia, where they can hide in the

205
00:12:33,898 --> 00:12:37,208
local online traffic and mask any connections to the

206
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:40,744
North Korean mainland. And even though Bureau 120

207
00:12:40,782 --> 00:12:43,972
one's teams are small, the US estimates

208
00:12:44,036 --> 00:12:48,052
that since 2010, the department has grown from a few hundred

209
00:12:48,126 --> 00:12:51,788
elite hackers to over 6000 in 2020.

210
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:55,548
However, how many of these have really gone through? The complete training

211
00:12:55,634 --> 00:12:59,548
is unknown. Nonetheless, with over 6000

212
00:12:59,634 --> 00:13:03,340
members and five people per group, there should be around

213
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,592
1200 different cyberhacking cells all

214
00:13:06,646 --> 00:13:10,432
around the world. And to this date, only six of these

215
00:13:10,486 --> 00:13:13,552
cells have been identified. So even though

216
00:13:13,606 --> 00:13:17,184
North Korea is often displayed as a laughingstock because of their

217
00:13:17,222 --> 00:13:20,976
senseless threats, it seems that they are indeed becoming a

218
00:13:20,998 --> 00:13:24,050
major player in the depths of the cyber world.
