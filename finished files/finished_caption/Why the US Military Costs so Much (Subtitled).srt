1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,946
At base, every military has defensive capabilities.

2
00:00:04,058 --> 00:00:06,874
They're able to protect their homeland from foreign threats.

3
00:00:07,002 --> 00:00:10,874
Iceland's armed forces, for example, comprise four ships, one airplane,

4
00:00:10,922 --> 00:00:14,558
three helicopters, and four radar stations, all operated by the

5
00:00:14,564 --> 00:00:17,866
country's Coast Guard. Beyond a small paramilitary peacekeeping

6
00:00:17,898 --> 00:00:21,354
unit made up of volunteers, the nation has nearly no capabilities

7
00:00:21,402 --> 00:00:25,206
to deploy abroad. In fact, its constitution doesn't even have a

8
00:00:25,228 --> 00:00:28,726
mechanism to declare war. Some militaries build on

9
00:00:28,748 --> 00:00:32,466
their defensive capabilities with limited expeditionary posturing.

10
00:00:32,578 --> 00:00:36,466
Ability to wage a small scale operation abroad. This requires

11
00:00:36,498 --> 00:00:39,590
an expensive mix of training, equipment, and planning.

12
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,894
Whereas domestic capabilities can be permanent and stationary, all expeditionary

13
00:00:43,942 --> 00:00:47,718
capabilities inherently must be designed to be temporary and mobile.

14
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:51,294
This spans from the ability to fire a missile to the ability to cook up

15
00:00:51,332 --> 00:00:54,954
breakfast, which raises costs and complexity dramatically.

16
00:00:55,082 --> 00:00:58,826
For this reason, large scale expeditionary capabilities are largely

17
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:02,522
confined to the largest, best funded militaries, like those of France,

18
00:01:02,586 --> 00:01:05,922
Mexico, or Canada. But then there's the

19
00:01:05,976 --> 00:01:09,730
US military. It is in a class of its own.

20
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,006
Whereas most nations can defend at home and some can deploy

21
00:01:13,038 --> 00:01:17,666
abroad, the US military has a rather singular strategic posture.

22
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:21,318
They have essentially turned the entire world into home

23
00:01:21,404 --> 00:01:25,206
turf. Their goal is complete. It's the ability to fight any sort of

24
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:28,230
fight, in any location, at any moment.

25
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,638
To an American, that might sound like the inherent function of a military,

26
00:01:31,734 --> 00:01:35,446
but it's a uniquely US approach. Most militaries are merely

27
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:38,726
designed to respond to relevant regional threats and can scale

28
00:01:38,758 --> 00:01:42,554
up to wage a war abroad if necessary. To be able to fulfill this

29
00:01:42,592 --> 00:01:46,330
all encompassing mission. The US military has a degree of flexibility

30
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,706
and globality unmatched by any other, which incurs

31
00:01:49,738 --> 00:01:53,082
a near endless array of exceptional costs for the force.

32
00:01:53,226 --> 00:01:56,686
They pay to produce their own private label of chicken tenderloins and ship it

33
00:01:56,708 --> 00:02:00,274
all around the world to places like this base in southeastern Turkey. Because they run

34
00:02:00,312 --> 00:02:03,602
a grocery store there. Because they have thousands of service members stationed there.

35
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:07,074
Because that's where they keep about 50 nuclear warheads in case they decide to use

36
00:02:07,112 --> 00:02:10,854
one in Europe, Africa, the Middle east, or elsewhere. They pay for

37
00:02:10,892 --> 00:02:14,566
professional sports teams to incorporate patriotic ceremonies honoring past and

38
00:02:14,588 --> 00:02:17,974
present service members into their games in order to help boost recruiting to the level

39
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:22,134
needed to staff all their roles worldwide. They pay to develop an occasionally

40
00:02:22,182 --> 00:02:25,926
viral bipedal humanoid robot because they believe that in the future they can gain

41
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:29,866
a competitive advantage against other forces by having these robots integrate into their

42
00:02:29,888 --> 00:02:33,322
ranks and fulfill the most dull, dirty, and dangerous tasks.

43
00:02:33,466 --> 00:02:36,942
These costs grow and grow atop each other, then span all

44
00:02:36,996 --> 00:02:40,698
around the world. From a spatial and logistical standpoint,

45
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:44,378
covering the globe is nothing less than a monumentally challenging and

46
00:02:44,404 --> 00:02:48,094
expensive task. Then there's the temporal component.

47
00:02:48,222 --> 00:02:51,826
Making sure that the right soldiers with the right weapons and technology are in

48
00:02:51,848 --> 00:02:55,214
the right locations requires a predictive approach and proactive

49
00:02:55,262 --> 00:02:58,786
planning and predicting what future warfare looks like. Then preparing

50
00:02:58,818 --> 00:03:02,418
for it, is also an extremely expensive endeavor.

51
00:03:02,594 --> 00:03:06,594
Take, for example, the USS Freedom, a first of its kind electoral

52
00:03:06,642 --> 00:03:10,546
combat ship commissioned in 2008. At just under 400ft,

53
00:03:10,578 --> 00:03:14,186
or 120 meters long. With this ship lacks in size, it more

54
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:17,738
than makes up for in design complexity and stateoftheart technology.

55
00:03:17,904 --> 00:03:21,930
This ship represents two entire decades of planning and predicting,

56
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,890
researching and developing, contracting and commissioning.

57
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,122
A nearly inconceivable dedication of time and resources,

58
00:03:28,186 --> 00:03:31,790
but one that begins to make sense when considering the expectations.

59
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,026
When conceived of in the 1990s, the latoral combat ship was meant to

60
00:03:36,068 --> 00:03:39,166
lead the American Navy for the next half century.

61
00:03:39,278 --> 00:03:43,326
With the Cold War coming to a close, the US Navy had found itself overindexed

62
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:46,574
in warships designed to patrol and battle on the high seas.

63
00:03:46,702 --> 00:03:50,230
Suddenly, without a comparable rivAl, the US was the world's single

64
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,022
naval superpower, and its fleet needed to reflect this new order.

65
00:03:54,156 --> 00:03:57,746
Now the new preeminent warrior was pirates, terrorists, and gunrunners

66
00:03:57,778 --> 00:04:01,474
zipping along coasts, requiring something nimble, fast, and flexible

67
00:04:01,522 --> 00:04:05,146
enough to keep pace in the in between. The coastal waters, where threats were

68
00:04:05,168 --> 00:04:09,222
diverse and warfare often asymmetrical to fill the void,

69
00:04:09,286 --> 00:04:12,474
Navy officials presented two ideas. The DD

70
00:04:12,522 --> 00:04:16,394
21, a larger ship capable of holding its own on tight coastal waters,

71
00:04:16,442 --> 00:04:19,722
or what planners called the street fighter. A smaller,

72
00:04:19,786 --> 00:04:22,798
sleeker, and critically cheaper option.

73
00:04:22,964 --> 00:04:26,174
From the jump, these street fighters were more appealing. They'd require

74
00:04:26,222 --> 00:04:30,702
smaller crews. They'd be fast, capable of surprising enemies. They'd be stealthy.

75
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:34,142
And with the advent of new hull technology, they'd be light enough to push

76
00:04:34,206 --> 00:04:38,178
45 knots while still having oceanwide range and carrying a

77
00:04:38,184 --> 00:04:42,242
payload. If that wasn't enough to futureproof such a concept, they'd be modular,

78
00:04:42,306 --> 00:04:46,082
too, capable of switching weapon systems and kits to fit different missions,

79
00:04:46,146 --> 00:04:50,146
from surface combat to minesweeping. But still, by 2000,

80
00:04:50,268 --> 00:04:53,738
such a Street fighter was just a concept. A concept that

81
00:04:53,744 --> 00:04:57,402
the Navy quickly turned over to private contractors after it proved too difficult

82
00:04:57,456 --> 00:05:01,254
to actualize in house, entering agreements with both General Dynamics

83
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:04,682
and Lockheed Martin to each produce two ships in two separate models,

84
00:05:04,746 --> 00:05:08,202
the Navy handed the project off to the private sector, assuming the competition

85
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:11,614
between the two for future LCS contracts would produce a 21st

86
00:05:11,652 --> 00:05:14,846
century mainstay. While the daunting scope had begun to add

87
00:05:14,868 --> 00:05:18,014
to the price tag, the Navy hoped these ships could come in relatively

88
00:05:18,062 --> 00:05:22,722
cheap by shipbuilding standards, somewhere between $150 to $225,000,000

89
00:05:22,776 --> 00:05:26,190
per unit. By 2009, the US had two ships,

90
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:30,106
one from each contractor, but not four, as budget overrun

91
00:05:30,158 --> 00:05:33,766
on both models was so extreme that the Navy canceled the contracts for the

92
00:05:33,788 --> 00:05:37,206
second of each. What was supposed to be in the 200 millions at

93
00:05:37,228 --> 00:05:40,794
most, had ballooned to about double the price. The issue was,

94
00:05:40,832 --> 00:05:44,214
however, the LCS remained a critical Cog

95
00:05:44,262 --> 00:05:48,218
in the planned New Age Navy fleet, and they needed to buy a lot more

96
00:05:48,304 --> 00:05:51,194
than 256 of them, in fact,

97
00:05:51,312 --> 00:05:54,718
or 82. Or 63, or 55,

98
00:05:54,804 --> 00:05:58,714
or, most recently, 52, depending on their evolving ship force structure

99
00:05:58,762 --> 00:06:01,950
projections. But no matter how many, they needed a lot,

100
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,206
and needed them fast, as LCSs were expected to replace old minesweepers

101
00:06:06,238 --> 00:06:09,586
and outdated frigates. And rather than settling on a single class of

102
00:06:09,608 --> 00:06:13,342
LCS as previously planned, to incentivize competition, they proposed Congress

103
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:17,234
an alternative, what they called a dual award strategy, offering each

104
00:06:17,272 --> 00:06:21,302
company a tent ship contract over the next five years. All the while,

105
00:06:21,356 --> 00:06:24,626
the problems with the Navy's current LCSs were already beginning

106
00:06:24,658 --> 00:06:28,034
to show. As a general rule in shipbuilding, a ship

107
00:06:28,082 --> 00:06:31,302
can have range, it can have speed, and it can have a heavy payload,

108
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:35,018
but it can't have all three at once. With speed as a

109
00:06:35,024 --> 00:06:38,458
principal mandate, both General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin had to

110
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:41,994
get creative and make sacrifices. While both classes are able

111
00:06:42,032 --> 00:06:45,646
to reach an incredible 44 knots, some ten to 15 more than

112
00:06:45,668 --> 00:06:49,038
a typical Navy ship, they made separate design choices to get there.

113
00:06:49,124 --> 00:06:52,890
For the independence class, this meant a unique aluminum trimaran haul.

114
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,666
As for the Freedom class, while Lockheed Martin went with a more conventional steel

115
00:06:56,698 --> 00:07:00,846
Monahaul, it innovated on the drivetrain side, developing a complicated combining

116
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:04,606
gear that connected the ship's diesel engines with its gas turbines.

117
00:07:04,718 --> 00:07:08,198
Both designs were innovative, but both had problems.

118
00:07:08,364 --> 00:07:11,846
Aluminum hulls, it turns out, are brittle, and at speeds of

119
00:07:11,868 --> 00:07:15,638
higher than just 15 knots, or on rough seas, they may well

120
00:07:15,724 --> 00:07:18,966
crack. As for the combining gear, well, they were hard

121
00:07:18,988 --> 00:07:22,454
to keep running, as the components were buried so deep in the ship that maintenance

122
00:07:22,502 --> 00:07:26,106
staff could hardly reach them. And when they broke down, as they did early and

123
00:07:26,128 --> 00:07:29,706
often, they were so complicated that Navy personnel had to wait around for

124
00:07:29,728 --> 00:07:33,434
Lockheed engineers to diagnose the problem and come up with a solution.

125
00:07:33,562 --> 00:07:37,306
Then there was the issue of survivability. Built as a combat

126
00:07:37,338 --> 00:07:41,386
ship, the LCS was intended to reach level one survivability, the ability

127
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:44,702
to continue operations after an underwater explosive attack

128
00:07:44,836 --> 00:07:48,434
in 2010, the same year it pushed for the Congressional Greenlight for

129
00:07:48,472 --> 00:07:52,078
20 more of these ships. The Navy conceded that the ships already produced

130
00:07:52,174 --> 00:07:55,522
hadn't reached level one survivability, and still,

131
00:07:55,656 --> 00:07:59,078
it got worse in the rush to get these ships on the

132
00:07:59,084 --> 00:08:03,222
water, no time was taken to ensure that all the ship modules actually worked.

133
00:08:03,356 --> 00:08:07,122
When they did get to testing the modules, it turned out they didn't.

134
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:10,410
The antisubmarine warfare module proved unreliable because

135
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,086
the ship itself is so loud that the toad sonar can't reliably

136
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:17,878
pick up any other noise. Similarly, the mine Countermeasures

137
00:08:17,894 --> 00:08:21,046
Mission package, which relies on onboard sensors and an unmanned

138
00:08:21,078 --> 00:08:24,766
influence sweep system, has been plagued with delays, breakdowns, and a

139
00:08:24,788 --> 00:08:28,366
penchant for causing false alarms. What was supposed to be an

140
00:08:28,388 --> 00:08:31,306
endlessly customizable ship, capable for surface combat,

141
00:08:31,338 --> 00:08:35,422
submarine hunting, and minesweeping, has effectively been rendered just a gunship

142
00:08:35,486 --> 00:08:38,946
that can't take a hit. Regardless of

143
00:08:38,968 --> 00:08:42,286
these varying limitations, as of 2023, the US Navy

144
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:45,534
has purchased 30 LCSs. They've broken

145
00:08:45,582 --> 00:08:49,026
down at sea, they've bumped into walls of the Panama Canal, they've spent

146
00:08:49,058 --> 00:08:52,438
a winter stuck in an iced over St. Lawrence river, they've run a handful of

147
00:08:52,444 --> 00:08:56,166
minor missions, and they've averaged about half a billion per

148
00:08:56,188 --> 00:08:59,606
ship to build. For a ship that was supposed to be the future,

149
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:03,398
the Latoral combat ship has proved nothing short of a disaster,

150
00:09:03,494 --> 00:09:06,982
a reality the Navy's finally begun to come to grips with by decommissioning,

151
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,486
or working towards decommissioning nine of the vessels.

152
00:09:10,678 --> 00:09:14,126
The LCS, by all metrics, has failed to live up to

153
00:09:14,148 --> 00:09:17,838
its lofty billing, and it has failed publicly and

154
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:21,134
expensively. But it's far from the only decades long

155
00:09:21,172 --> 00:09:24,938
development project that's fallen on its face. Boeing Sikorsky

156
00:09:24,954 --> 00:09:28,434
won the contract to build the Comanche helicopter in 1991, but after

157
00:09:28,472 --> 00:09:31,874
a decade of work and $7 billion being poured into the project,

158
00:09:31,992 --> 00:09:36,126
only two prototypes ever actually left the ground. As for America's

159
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:39,686
first stealth destroyer, the Zumwalt, its gun system has yet to

160
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:43,410
prove the range it's promised. Its missile system can't hit targets consistently,

161
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,350
and its guided shells cost a prohibitive $800,000

162
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,290
per unit. With similarly high hopes as the LCS, the Zoomwalt project

163
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,538
was eventually cut after only three ships were built.

164
00:09:54,704 --> 00:09:57,466
Then, most famously the F 35,

165
00:09:57,568 --> 00:10:00,938
the Joint strike Fighter. Adaptable future forward, state of

166
00:10:00,944 --> 00:10:04,366
the art has seen one technical glitch and one busted budget after the

167
00:10:04,388 --> 00:10:08,846
next. For two whole decades. It's cost ballooning to 89%

168
00:10:08,948 --> 00:10:12,634
over what was initially predicted. And the list goes on with countless

169
00:10:12,682 --> 00:10:16,398
other, smaller, multibillion dollar projects.

170
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:20,434
To a certain extent, such mistakes and miscalculations make

171
00:10:20,472 --> 00:10:24,206
sense when working to invent the future of warfare expensive swings

172
00:10:24,238 --> 00:10:28,214
and misses are part of the development process. But it wasn't always this

173
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,526
way. And increasingly it seems the swings have

174
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:34,886
gotten bigger and the misses more frequent. When the

175
00:10:34,908 --> 00:10:38,550
Department of Defense wants a ship or a plane or a weapon system built,

176
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,486
there's a select group of five companies. It typically turns to Lockheed

177
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:46,166
Martin, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and General Dynamics.

178
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:49,418
Excluding Boeing, all these companies earn the majority of

179
00:10:49,424 --> 00:10:53,102
their revenue from US or allied military contracts, which only

180
00:10:53,156 --> 00:10:56,874
happen with the approval of the US. But even excluding foreign defense

181
00:10:56,922 --> 00:11:00,254
revenue, 71% of Lockheed Martin revenue, for example,

182
00:11:00,372 --> 00:11:04,626
comes from the US government. That translates to $47.5

183
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:08,606
billion a year. Put another way, Lockheed Martin

184
00:11:08,638 --> 00:11:12,318
is given more by the US government each year than NASA,

185
00:11:12,414 --> 00:11:15,898
a major government agency. In fact, if the Defense

186
00:11:15,934 --> 00:11:19,682
contractor was a government agency, it'd be the 24th

187
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:23,650
largest. It gets more money from the US government than the majority

188
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,978
of government agencies. But unlike agencies,

189
00:11:27,074 --> 00:11:31,258
thanks to this business, Lockheed Martin profits nearly a billion dollars

190
00:11:31,344 --> 00:11:34,982
a month. But war wasn't always such a profitable

191
00:11:35,046 --> 00:11:38,806
venture. Technology was what brought the private sector

192
00:11:38,838 --> 00:11:42,426
to battle. Whereas in centuries past, militaries were primarily defined

193
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:46,282
by human might, the advent of airplanes marked perhaps the biggest

194
00:11:46,346 --> 00:11:49,614
instance yet of a non military technology that could be

195
00:11:49,652 --> 00:11:53,678
used to gain a militaristic advantage. During and after World War I,

196
00:11:53,764 --> 00:11:57,154
a number of fledgling airspace companies gained modest contracts, with the US

197
00:11:57,192 --> 00:12:00,830
military, contributing to annual overall production counts in the dozens

198
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,510
or hundreds. But then came World War II. Suddenly,

199
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,878
the US and its allies needed as many planes as they could get.

200
00:12:07,964 --> 00:12:11,666
And with that, the US government started awarding colossal contracts

201
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:14,594
to anyone who could build an aircraft. Lockheed,

202
00:12:14,642 --> 00:12:18,306
Goodyear, McDonald, Douglas, Boeing, Hughes, Grumman, Northrop,

203
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:21,846
Vought, Conveyor, and more. While all these companies had existed

204
00:12:21,878 --> 00:12:25,670
in some form prior, the war was, for all intents and purposes,

205
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,654
what established them. McDonald, for example, went from 15 employees

206
00:12:29,702 --> 00:12:33,498
to 5000. Hughes went from four to

207
00:12:33,584 --> 00:12:36,938
80,000 as a sum, whereas in the six years leading

208
00:12:36,954 --> 00:12:40,414
up to the war, the US built a mere 20,000 aircraft. During it,

209
00:12:40,452 --> 00:12:45,540
the country's manufacturers produced a massive 300,000.

210
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:49,858
But then the war ended, and this was bad for business.

211
00:12:50,024 --> 00:12:53,678
Aircraft manufacturers immediately struggled. Some shifted

212
00:12:53,694 --> 00:12:57,842
towards civilian aviation. Others refocused on auto manufacturing. Others still

213
00:12:57,896 --> 00:13:01,126
consolidated, while the US government searched for contracts that could be used to

214
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:04,978
keep this new industrial sector, which played no small part in the Allied victory,

215
00:13:05,074 --> 00:13:08,946
afloat. Rather quickly, though, a new conflict emerged.

216
00:13:09,058 --> 00:13:12,854
The Cold War. In its early days, rumors arose

217
00:13:12,902 --> 00:13:16,070
that the Soviet Union had produced an inconceivable quantity

218
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,338
of long range bombers. As the world had now entered the

219
00:13:19,344 --> 00:13:23,302
nuclear age. This massively concerned American media, the public,

220
00:13:23,376 --> 00:13:26,906
and ultimately Congress. It was believed that their newfound enemy could straight

221
00:13:26,938 --> 00:13:30,974
up eradicate the US. In response, Eisenhower ordered an

222
00:13:31,012 --> 00:13:34,538
immediate ramp up of American bomber production and agreed to a Lockheed

223
00:13:34,554 --> 00:13:38,366
proposal to develop the U two high altitude surveillance aircraft.

224
00:13:38,478 --> 00:13:41,982
It would fly over the Soviet Union undetected, at least theoretically,

225
00:13:42,046 --> 00:13:45,726
and get a definitive answer to just how formidable their bomber fleet

226
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:49,234
had become. The answer was not much. It was a mere

227
00:13:49,282 --> 00:13:52,786
fraction of what had been speculated. But Lockheed and other manufacturers

228
00:13:52,818 --> 00:13:56,486
had already cashed their checks, so the answer meant little to them.

229
00:13:56,588 --> 00:14:00,678
A near identical story emerged just a few years later with missiles

230
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:04,314
the Soviets had launched. Sputnik and the Democrats of the ERA used the event

231
00:14:04,352 --> 00:14:08,086
to propagate a narrative that Eisenhower and his Republican Party were falling

232
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:11,226
behind Soviet technological development. John F.

233
00:14:11,248 --> 00:14:14,846
Kennedy, in the run up to the 1960 presidential election, latched on

234
00:14:14,868 --> 00:14:18,314
to inflated estimates of Soviet missile capabilities, leaked from the Air force,

235
00:14:18,362 --> 00:14:22,138
and started to make the perceived imbalance a central part of his campaign.

236
00:14:22,234 --> 00:14:25,730
He argued that his political foes were ignoring this threat and the American

237
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,538
public believed him. Even after having received definitive evidence to

238
00:14:29,544 --> 00:14:33,214
refute this fact. He continued the rhetoric. It was just so useful

239
00:14:33,262 --> 00:14:37,134
politically, which contributed to an acceleration of U. S. Missile development.

240
00:14:37,262 --> 00:14:40,962
This was a much needed windfall for U. S. Aerospace companies, given the waning

241
00:14:41,026 --> 00:14:44,454
need for high volume aircraft development. It was this very

242
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:48,114
incident, in fact, that precipitated the first use of the phrase military

243
00:14:48,162 --> 00:14:51,798
industrial complex in Eisenhower's farewell address, where he warned of

244
00:14:51,804 --> 00:14:55,014
the phenomena's danger. The subsequent escalation

245
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:58,566
of the Cold War kept the defense industry alive and kicked off an era

246
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:02,266
of growth as US military spending started to consistently increase.

247
00:15:02,378 --> 00:15:05,806
But then the wall came down with no more

248
00:15:05,828 --> 00:15:09,354
Cold War, the DoD warned contractors of massive

249
00:15:09,402 --> 00:15:12,954
cutbacks in spending. This kicked off a feeding frenzy

250
00:15:13,002 --> 00:15:16,222
of consolidation and acquisition as the industry prepared to weather

251
00:15:16,286 --> 00:15:20,702
what they believed would be the first sustained period of peace in their existence.

252
00:15:20,846 --> 00:15:24,238
Defense spending did decrease, but only slightly,

253
00:15:24,334 --> 00:15:27,862
and only for a moment. 911 and the ensuing wars quickly

254
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:31,430
returned the US to the historical trend of near perpetual spending build.

255
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,886
And today, with these wars largely wrapped up, the new most

256
00:15:34,908 --> 00:15:39,270
popular justification for military spending is growing. Chinese military

257
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,550
might. Now, many of these supposed threats

258
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:46,186
may be legitimate, but it's tough to know with confidence because the

259
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:50,262
defense industry, its lobbyists and politicians are incredibly

260
00:15:50,326 --> 00:15:53,758
effective at shaping public discourse. In fact,

261
00:15:53,844 --> 00:15:57,294
the vast majority of the top think tanks are funded, at least in

262
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:00,782
part by defense contractors. These same

263
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:04,382
think tanks are what are used by politicians and the media as supposedly

264
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:08,430
expert justification for funding to counter new emerging threats.

265
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:12,478
Ignoring for the moment the more unknowable question of whether warmongering

266
00:16:12,494 --> 00:16:15,906
for the sake of defense industry profits is effective. In practice,

267
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:19,638
it's undeniable that the incentive structures are certainly

268
00:16:19,724 --> 00:16:23,474
there. But perhaps the best evidence for this phenomena's influence

269
00:16:23,522 --> 00:16:27,106
is the fact that, inflation adjusted, today's military spending

270
00:16:27,138 --> 00:16:30,726
is approaching World War II levels, despite no active

271
00:16:30,758 --> 00:16:34,086
US involvement in any major conflicts.

272
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:37,446
Of course, one can still debate whether this level of spending

273
00:16:37,478 --> 00:16:41,346
is justified by the present geopolitical landscape. But what's undeniable

274
00:16:41,398 --> 00:16:44,686
is that taxpayers are getting less and less for

275
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:48,618
their money. There was a time when defense spending had undeniably

276
00:16:48,714 --> 00:16:52,394
massive downstream effects. The US military was a major financial

277
00:16:52,442 --> 00:16:56,046
force behind the development of world changing innovations like nuclear

278
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:00,402
technology, GPS, and the Internet. In fact, in the 1960s,

279
00:17:00,456 --> 00:17:04,066
a full third of the entire world's research and

280
00:17:04,088 --> 00:17:08,178
development funding came from US defense related spending.

281
00:17:08,354 --> 00:17:11,846
But today that share has shrunk to a mere 3%.

282
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:15,414
And what was once perhaps the most innovative force in the world has

283
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:18,994
become downright bad at it. The US auto industry,

284
00:17:19,042 --> 00:17:22,506
for example, has quickened its pace of development. It now

285
00:17:22,528 --> 00:17:25,894
gets a car to market faster. The US commercial aircraft

286
00:17:25,942 --> 00:17:29,990
industry has trended slightly slower. Yet in the realm of military aircraft,

287
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,310
something dramatic has occurred. What used to take

288
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:37,018
three or five or seven years now stretches

289
00:17:37,114 --> 00:17:40,926
into decades. A key part of the problem is that

290
00:17:40,948 --> 00:17:44,438
the government has taken the inefficiencies of the public sector and pushed

291
00:17:44,474 --> 00:17:48,046
them into the private sector, where they can be profited upon.

292
00:17:48,158 --> 00:17:51,442
When developing a new generation of aircraft or ship or

293
00:17:51,496 --> 00:17:55,362
anything, the DoD sets strict parameters that

294
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:58,694
flips traditional incentive structures. Most industries see

295
00:17:58,732 --> 00:18:01,894
the private sector innovate in order to create new products that their

296
00:18:01,932 --> 00:18:05,106
customers will want. In this case, the customer tells

297
00:18:05,138 --> 00:18:08,594
the private sector exactly what they want. And this industry spends

298
00:18:08,642 --> 00:18:12,474
heavily on lobbyists, many of whom used to work for the DoD in order

299
00:18:12,512 --> 00:18:15,766
to shape contracts towards where they can build with minimal risky

300
00:18:15,798 --> 00:18:18,918
research and development, therefore stifling innovation.

301
00:18:19,094 --> 00:18:22,442
But even then, the risk for the contractor is mitigated

302
00:18:22,506 --> 00:18:25,966
further because a big chunk of contracts are awarded on

303
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:29,870
a cost plus basis. That's to say, the government

304
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,694
pays for what it costs to build a given technology. Then the contractor

305
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:38,446
gets a percentage on top of that as profit. This directly

306
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:42,670
disincentivizes cost efficiency, as the more a project costs,

307
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,890
the more the contractor makes. Of course,

308
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,718
in normal industries, the contractor would still be incentivized towards efficiency in

309
00:18:49,724 --> 00:18:53,606
order to win the next contract. But in this industry, two thirds of

310
00:18:53,628 --> 00:18:57,442
major weapons system contracts for example, are bid upon by just one

311
00:18:57,516 --> 00:19:01,174
company, while yet more contracts are awarded without a competitive

312
00:19:01,222 --> 00:19:04,922
bidding process. Perhaps most egregiously, it's well

313
00:19:04,976 --> 00:19:08,150
understood that some contracts are awarded to struggling,

314
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,694
ineffective companies simply because the US government does

315
00:19:11,732 --> 00:19:14,766
not want that company to go bankrupt and therefore for

316
00:19:14,788 --> 00:19:18,190
its manufacturing capabilities to be lost.

317
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:22,250
This is perhaps one of the strongest justifications for the spending

318
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,694
the US military cannot afford for Lockheed or Boeing

319
00:19:25,742 --> 00:19:29,394
or Raytheon or the other contractors to go bankrupt because they are

320
00:19:29,432 --> 00:19:32,866
the only companies in the world capable of producing the

321
00:19:32,888 --> 00:19:36,722
technologies that bestow the fighting force with such a technological

322
00:19:36,786 --> 00:19:41,062
advantage. So a situation has been crafted where these companies are

323
00:19:41,116 --> 00:19:44,674
too important to fail, and they know that. So they can profit

324
00:19:44,722 --> 00:19:48,706
off of their necessity rather than their effectiveness.

325
00:19:48,898 --> 00:19:52,166
The aforementioned only scratches the surface of the deep

326
00:19:52,198 --> 00:19:55,798
web of incentives that keeps the military industrial complex alive.

327
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:58,698
But at its core, it's as simple as this.

328
00:19:58,784 --> 00:20:02,330
It is good for politicians politically, and good for contractors

329
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,882
economically to create the perception of problems that simply

330
00:20:05,946 --> 00:20:09,486
do not exist. No one gets punished when a

331
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:12,538
threat does not materialize. In fact, they can

332
00:20:12,564 --> 00:20:16,494
argue that their response, upon which they profited politically or economically,

333
00:20:16,622 --> 00:20:19,054
mitigated the threat. Meanwhile,

334
00:20:19,182 --> 00:20:22,434
individuals are punished when a threat they argued did not

335
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:26,486
exist, materializes, disincentivizing anyone from doing so.

336
00:20:26,668 --> 00:20:29,698
Fear is an incredibly powerful emotion,

337
00:20:29,794 --> 00:20:33,574
and at its core, the military industrial complex has

338
00:20:33,612 --> 00:20:37,266
created an incredibly effective system to capitalize

339
00:20:37,378 --> 00:20:38,360
upon it.

340
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:43,770
As you might have noticed, the last Wendover video is no longer

341
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,466
on YouTube. It's a somewhat long and frustrating story, but to

342
00:20:47,488 --> 00:20:51,414
summarize, there was a quick clip in it where you could see some personal info

343
00:20:51,462 --> 00:20:54,986
on a passport. YouTube's harassment and cyberbullying policy includes

344
00:20:55,018 --> 00:20:58,718
a provision against sharing personally identifiable information such as this.

345
00:20:58,804 --> 00:21:02,318
And even though it was clearly unintentional, the video was taken down as a policy

346
00:21:02,404 --> 00:21:05,262
strike, which seems fair given the wording of this policy.

347
00:21:05,396 --> 00:21:08,418
Unfortunately, unlike with most privacy issues on YouTube videos,

348
00:21:08,504 --> 00:21:12,014
because this was taken down as a policy strike, there is no ability

349
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:15,234
for us to rectify the issue, even though it could be done with a quick

350
00:21:15,272 --> 00:21:18,638
blur. So the video is down permanently, at least on YouTube.

351
00:21:18,734 --> 00:21:21,974
You see, a couple years ago, some creator friends and I got together to try

352
00:21:22,012 --> 00:21:25,766
to both build on the best parts of YouTube and rectify some of its issues.

353
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:29,414
We called it Nebula, and it's gone fantastically, with over half

354
00:21:29,452 --> 00:21:32,662
a million subscribers, hundreds of thousands of monthly active users,

355
00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:36,246
streaming award nominations, and more. But one small way we improved

356
00:21:36,278 --> 00:21:39,674
from YouTube was by adding this, a little button on our back end

357
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:42,982
that allows the creator to swap files on a video to correct mistakes,

358
00:21:43,046 --> 00:21:46,642
make improvements, or in this case, blur that passport.

359
00:21:46,726 --> 00:21:50,734
So the video's still up on Nebula, but we also designed the platform with

360
00:21:50,772 --> 00:21:54,606
a unique business model that allows us to fund higher budget, exclusive content.

361
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:58,386
So another video that's up on Nebula is the latest episode of the logistics of

362
00:21:58,408 --> 00:22:02,146
X about arms manufacturing. It builds on this video's topic to show the

363
00:22:02,168 --> 00:22:05,986
nitty gritty of how the US military and its industry partners manufacture and

364
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:09,454
distribute the physical weapons of war, without those weapons endangering

365
00:22:09,502 --> 00:22:12,310
anyone along the way. Clearly, you made it to the end of this video,

366
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,366
so I know you'll enjoy that one as it was written from the beginning to

367
00:22:15,388 --> 00:22:18,706
appeal to those that enjoyed this video. We have a huge slate

368
00:22:18,738 --> 00:22:22,006
of originals incoming over the next couple of months, plenty of which I'm sure you'll

369
00:22:22,038 --> 00:22:25,226
want to watch. Then, in addition to the logistics of X, we have

370
00:22:25,248 --> 00:22:29,066
perhaps the most ambitious, highest budget Wendover original to date in

371
00:22:29,088 --> 00:22:32,714
pre production right now. And if all that's not convincing enough already, it's worth

372
00:22:32,752 --> 00:22:36,046
mentioning that we designed Nebula to really be worthwhile, not only to you,

373
00:22:36,068 --> 00:22:39,502
the viewer, but also to the creators. When you sign up at our link,

374
00:22:39,556 --> 00:22:43,274
we'll get a portion of your subscription revenue for as long as you stay subscribed,

375
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:46,506
which gives us stable, predictable monthly revenue that we can rely

376
00:22:46,538 --> 00:22:49,802
on for growth, unlike with the ebbs and flows of ad rates.

377
00:22:49,866 --> 00:22:53,114
So if you'd like to get access to Nebula's huge catalog of original

378
00:22:53,162 --> 00:22:56,486
content and help support the channel, just click the button on screen or head to

379
00:22:56,508 --> 00:23:00,434

381
00:23:03,948 --> 00:23:04,520
month.
