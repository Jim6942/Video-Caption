1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,480
Three, two, one, go.

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,400
Oh, my God. Wow.

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,174
This is amazing. This is so

4
00:00:12,292 --> 00:00:15,786
gorgeous. No, I'm studying like a Millie rocket skin,

5
00:00:15,818 --> 00:00:19,166
clear silicon Andy Miller. Knock his money in my pocket. Don't call

6
00:00:19,188 --> 00:00:22,106
me a money pocket. And you can get to rocket. It's not like a thunder

7
00:00:22,138 --> 00:00:25,670
racket. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning.

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,846
What is up, everyone? Today is a big day. Okay. So this

9
00:00:29,868 --> 00:00:33,430
video has taken me three months to make. As you can see behind

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,770
me, this is my brand new car collection.

11
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,754
And after three months, it's finally here.

12
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:43,494
Oh, my God. This is literally like a dream.

13
00:00:43,542 --> 00:00:47,580
Guys, this is the last time you're ever going to see them like this,

14
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,398
okay? This could be the best decision of my life. Or the worst decision.

15
00:00:53,494 --> 00:00:56,970
So the cars have officially left the house. They're on the way to the garage.

16
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,462
When you wrap one car, it's fine, but when you wrap five,

17
00:01:00,596 --> 00:01:03,280
there's no going back. Hello. Hello,

18
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,990
my bro. Bro, good to see you. Good to see.

19
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,130
Foilers, my passion. We're going to do something crazy for you.

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,346
Okay, guys, so right now, we just made it to my friend's place. It's time

21
00:01:13,368 --> 00:01:16,018
to see what we're going to do. It's one of the biggest projects I've done

22
00:01:16,024 --> 00:01:18,658
in the last five years. We got a Ferrari, two Bentleys,

23
00:01:18,754 --> 00:01:22,166
Rollsroyce, SLS. What's the last car? I forgot all

24
00:01:22,188 --> 00:01:25,686
my cars. What can we do? I want something crazy. So we

25
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:29,126
have this four tone. It's got a purple, it's got a green, it's got a

26
00:01:29,148 --> 00:01:32,794
red, orange, everything. I mean, do you want to do something like this? So this

27
00:01:32,832 --> 00:01:35,754
car changes color. It's like chameleon color.

28
00:01:35,792 --> 00:01:39,190
Keeps changing. Wow. But do you want to do this? Do you have different colors?

29
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,974
Okay. Matte black. What about this, bro? But again, every Tom,

30
00:01:43,012 --> 00:01:46,238
Dick, and Harry does this. All right, let's go look at

31
00:01:46,244 --> 00:01:49,200
some colors. Okay. Oh, my God.

32
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,846
All right, Aziz, where do we start? So we've got a lot

33
00:01:54,868 --> 00:01:58,706
of colors over here. More than 100 colors. It's confusing me. I like the

34
00:01:58,728 --> 00:02:02,930
purples. I like the pink. How about a green? This is nice. How about this,

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,306
bro? Carbon fiber. One of a kind I did on

36
00:02:06,328 --> 00:02:10,040
a Lamborghini hurricane. Wow. How about this? And this?

37
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,478
I think I like that. Oh, my God, guYs. Or do you want to

38
00:02:13,484 --> 00:02:17,560
do some design? I think we need something different.

39
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:22,966
Hey, guys. So it's been about an hour, and I think we finally decided.

40
00:02:23,078 --> 00:02:26,586
I am shocked. The color, what you've selected is going to be crazy,

41
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,780
bro. Crazy. All right, let's do it.

42
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,400
Oh, my God.

43
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,590
Yo, this is insane.

44
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,254
Welcome to my new car collection.

45
00:02:46,382 --> 00:02:50,066
Okay, guys, so right now, we just made it here. Do you see this?

46
00:02:50,168 --> 00:02:53,922
This is crazy, guys. Yo, they're all

47
00:02:53,976 --> 00:02:57,720
purple. Let's go through the freaking cars. Let's go through them.

48
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,818
So, since we're here, obviously there's not just my car collection.

49
00:03:04,914 --> 00:03:08,294
We also have my mom's Rollsroyce. Mommy, come. My mom is just

50
00:03:08,332 --> 00:03:11,402
a show. Oh, my God. What do you think? Very nice.

51
00:03:11,456 --> 00:03:14,406
Actually, she's my mom, too. Yeah. Mommy.

52
00:03:14,438 --> 00:03:17,946
Mommy. Guys, see, Mommy? Mom's car is now part

53
00:03:17,968 --> 00:03:21,434
of the collection. It could be pink, but this is honestly

54
00:03:21,562 --> 00:03:24,974
more nicer. Mommy, have you seen the

55
00:03:25,012 --> 00:03:26,750
rose? Yes. Purple.

56
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,262
This is crazy. I don't know what to say, bro. Thank you, thank you,

57
00:03:31,396 --> 00:03:34,794
thank you. This is crazy, guys. I'm sweating

58
00:03:34,842 --> 00:03:37,682
right now. I don't even know what to say, bro. How so? Guys, this is

59
00:03:37,736 --> 00:03:41,454
one of a kind. The purple wrap majern. This is a premium purple.

60
00:03:41,582 --> 00:03:45,166
If you see the grains and the effect of the purple wrap,

61
00:03:45,198 --> 00:03:48,594
it's so beautiful. But this is crazy. Yeah, it is. And you are the first

62
00:03:48,632 --> 00:03:51,094
one I'm applying it on. This is the first time you do this color.

63
00:03:51,212 --> 00:03:55,010
I'm using this color and this brand. It's not a vinyl. It's not a plastic.

64
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:58,438
Damn. This is crazy, bro. Hey, Mo, I've got a surprise for

65
00:03:58,444 --> 00:04:01,766
you. You have another surprise? Can you read this?

66
00:04:01,948 --> 00:04:05,542
No. This glows in the dark. They have my

67
00:04:05,596 --> 00:04:08,562
name on the brakes of this car. That's sick.

68
00:04:08,626 --> 00:04:11,994
That's insane. Glows in the dark. It glows in the dark.

69
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:15,194
Yeah, bro. Bro. Alan, what do you think, bro? Next level, man. A whole nother

70
00:04:15,242 --> 00:04:18,346
level, bro. We're taking things to the next level. I promise you, bro. Alan,

71
00:04:18,378 --> 00:04:21,374
this is wild. This is my car collection. This is it? Maybe.

72
00:04:21,412 --> 00:04:24,366
What else do I say? We're gonna quickly rearrange the cars. I need to take

73
00:04:24,388 --> 00:04:27,326
some photos for Instagram. That's what I need to do, bro. I think we got

74
00:04:27,348 --> 00:04:30,506
a new driver, bro. We got a new driver on the Ferrari. I think he's

75
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:33,040
six, but, I mean, if he can drive, he can drive.

76
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,566
Matching keys to the card. Yo,

77
00:04:54,758 --> 00:04:58,860
this is wild, guys. Have you ever seen a purple key before?

78
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,180
The key matches the car.

79
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,446
It works. See? As is my brother. Thank you

80
00:05:06,468 --> 00:05:08,160
again. Yeah.

81
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,000
One of you got a whole left side. Yeah.

82
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,290
There you go. Guys, it's time to get my sister and see her reaction.

83
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,306
What's happening? Lana, are you ready? For what? To see

84
00:05:22,328 --> 00:05:25,942
our new car collection. Not again. Yeah. Oh,

85
00:05:25,996 --> 00:05:28,662
my God. What is going on?

86
00:05:28,716 --> 00:05:31,190
Bro, like, why are the cars covered?

87
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:36,194
It's time. Who does that? Damn, bro. Red carpet wipes,

88
00:05:36,242 --> 00:05:39,366
man. I don't know what's behind that. What color is it? I have a surprise

89
00:05:39,398 --> 00:05:42,330
for you, too. What is it? I got you a car. No, you didn't.

90
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,860
What car is that?

91
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:50,074
Broken BMW? Exactly. My fake beat up. What is

92
00:05:50,112 --> 00:05:52,638
it? You think I'm Mr. Beast? Bro. Bro. Mr.

93
00:05:52,724 --> 00:05:56,574
Beast. Seriously? All the

94
00:05:56,612 --> 00:05:59,866
cars? Yep. Every single one. Like, did you just grab

95
00:05:59,898 --> 00:06:03,034
all the cars and just decide? Like, let me just change them up.

96
00:06:03,092 --> 00:06:06,786
Yep, exactly. Does mom have any idea about this? Yep. You're the

97
00:06:06,808 --> 00:06:09,662
only one that didn't know. This is the whole collection.

98
00:06:09,806 --> 00:06:12,980
Okay. Three, two, one, go.

99
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,840
Oh, my God. Wow.

100
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:22,614
This is amazing. This is so

101
00:06:22,732 --> 00:06:26,134
gorgeous, bro. You killed it,

102
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:29,546
right? I had no idea, Mo. Like, you should

103
00:06:29,568 --> 00:06:32,234
have done my car, too. I didn't know.

104
00:06:32,352 --> 00:06:35,882
Damn, bro. And all of them, like, this looks

105
00:06:35,936 --> 00:06:39,962
so badass. Wow. Oh, my God. Let me step

106
00:06:40,016 --> 00:06:43,242
back for a second. Isn't this crazy? I am in love with

107
00:06:43,296 --> 00:06:47,086
this. It's going to look so crazy on the road. I feel like people are

108
00:06:47,108 --> 00:06:51,146
just gonna like, what? So there you go. That is the car collection.

109
00:06:51,258 --> 00:06:55,042
Now it's time for the best part. Driving them. Let's take them to the road.

110
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:58,514
Let's go. All right, switch it on. Here's the Ferrari. Can I drive

111
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:01,540
the SLS? You want the SLS? You can. Here,

112
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,782
I'm allowed. Yep. It's okay? Yeah. All right.

113
00:07:05,836 --> 00:07:08,440
I'm going to drive the SLS. All right. Let's go.

114
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,440
Wow.

115
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,990
Okay. Why is that? With these doors,

116
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,518
bro, you can't close it. Is it normal?

117
00:07:22,614 --> 00:07:26,170
Yeah. Why did you guys come?

118
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,022
High doors. I need a button for this. Can you customize it? No.

119
00:07:30,096 --> 00:07:31,550
Okay, come on. Close the doors.

120
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:40,478
Oh, my God. All right, guys, I got lie. Today's a

121
00:07:40,484 --> 00:07:44,158
good day. It's time to go to the road. You did not put petrol in

122
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:47,758
this car. Really? It says fuel reserve. Oh, no.

123
00:07:47,844 --> 00:07:50,080
All right. I guess we just have to do what we got to do.

124
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,810
You don't.
