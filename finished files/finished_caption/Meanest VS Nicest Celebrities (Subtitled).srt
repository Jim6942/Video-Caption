1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,530
Who were the five nicest celebrities and who were the five meanest?

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,686
I can tell you who. The meanest one I ever met. Uh oh. Her name

3
00:00:06,708 --> 00:00:09,994
is Ellen DeGeneres. But while all the evidence points to Ellen

4
00:00:10,042 --> 00:00:13,422
being awful, Adam Sandler is always highlighted as being

5
00:00:13,476 --> 00:00:16,874
incredibly kind. Take for example the time he was refused a table

6
00:00:16,922 --> 00:00:20,942
at IHOP after the server failed to realize it was Adam Sandler asking.

7
00:00:21,076 --> 00:00:24,202
Embarrassed, the server shared the CCTV to TikTok,

8
00:00:24,266 --> 00:00:28,246
prompting Adam Sandler to meet with the waitress personally while joking about the

9
00:00:28,268 --> 00:00:32,214
rejection by stating, for the record, I only left the IHOP because the nice

10
00:00:32,252 --> 00:00:35,554
woman told me the all you can eat deal didn't apply to the milkshakes.

11
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:39,506
Although fans were impressed for a slightly different reason, it's very humble

12
00:00:39,538 --> 00:00:42,950
of him to not assert that he's a celebrity and ask for special treatment.

13
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,934
He acted just like a regular customer and didn't challenge anyone. I respect

14
00:00:46,982 --> 00:00:50,774
him for that, with his humble attitude extending to wedding photo bombs

15
00:00:50,822 --> 00:00:54,400
and that time he randomly appeared for some chicken. Hi guys.

16
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,542
No way. No way.

17
00:00:58,596 --> 00:01:02,206
You're joking. He filmed a good chunk of Mr. Deeds in my hometown and

18
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:05,786
he was simply the nicest man ever. He would come out to sign autographs

19
00:01:05,818 --> 00:01:09,234
after a full 14 plus hour day of shooting. Didn't matter how

20
00:01:09,272 --> 00:01:12,434
long the line was, he made sure every single person got to

21
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:15,666
say hello. He had time for photographs and chats with everyone in

22
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:19,262
town, frequented all the local coffee shops, and posed with employees.

23
00:01:19,326 --> 00:01:22,726
He seemed to really care and know how excited we all were to have a

24
00:01:22,748 --> 00:01:26,534
movie happening and always had a smile. Although Adam's fans are the only

25
00:01:26,572 --> 00:01:29,994
people to talk very highly of him. You guys love

26
00:01:30,032 --> 00:01:33,066
each other. Is that fair to say? For sure,

27
00:01:33,168 --> 00:01:36,730
yeah. I hear each of you individually talking about the other

28
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,314
in such fond terminology. Yeah. After Pete Davidson worked with

29
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:44,026
Adam Sandler on Saturday Night Live, Pete went on to state, he's just such a

30
00:01:44,048 --> 00:01:47,630
cool, nice guy. I can't explain how wonderful of a person he is.

31
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,926
Just like caring and sweet and not full of crap, which is very rare to

32
00:01:50,948 --> 00:01:54,154
find. But while Adam SanDler's happy onscreen mood clearly

33
00:01:54,202 --> 00:01:57,826
extends to his personal life, Mike Myers from Austin Powers is

34
00:01:57,848 --> 00:02:01,326
apparently much different. When the cameras aren't rolling, Twitter users

35
00:02:01,358 --> 00:02:04,418
expose Mike Myers as an absolute nightmare to work with.

36
00:02:04,504 --> 00:02:07,794
The article referred to a tweet reading, Mike Myers had me fight off the set

37
00:02:07,832 --> 00:02:11,206
of the Love Guru because I made eye contact with him and

38
00:02:11,228 --> 00:02:14,566
I was there as his bodyguard. The tweet had been posted by a

39
00:02:14,588 --> 00:02:18,418
person named Jay Brody, who then expanded on the incident in a podcast,

40
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:21,766
you'll be basically guarding Mike Myers'trailer. They're like,

41
00:02:21,788 --> 00:02:25,482
here's the catch. Can't look at him. But I realized I can't let just anyone

42
00:02:25,536 --> 00:02:28,874
into the trailer. So I look up, I catch his eye for a

43
00:02:28,912 --> 00:02:32,234
second, I give him a nod to let him know I'm cool, and then I

44
00:02:32,272 --> 00:02:35,438
look away and within an hour I get a phone call letting me know

45
00:02:35,444 --> 00:02:38,446
that I'm fired and I have to get off set, prompting others to give their

46
00:02:38,468 --> 00:02:41,758
own anecdotes about Mike Meyer's terrible attitude. I was

47
00:02:41,764 --> 00:02:45,310
an extra in Love Guru and remember being told we can't make eye contact

48
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,278
with Mike. When I tell people this, they don't believe me. Thanks for confirming.

49
00:02:49,374 --> 00:02:53,134
People always wonder why there weren't more Austin Powers movies, but never realize

50
00:02:53,182 --> 00:02:56,866
how many stories there are like this about him. Basically, no one wants to

51
00:02:56,888 --> 00:02:59,950
work with the guy with one of these other stories coming from the set of

52
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,446
the cat in the hat where Mike's co star Amy Hill stated his

53
00:03:03,468 --> 00:03:07,030
area was all covered with tenting because he didn't want anybody seeing him.

54
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,030
It was so weird. It was just the worst. I was miserable.

55
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,558
Hill also revealed how diva Myers selfishly kept everyone waiting

56
00:03:13,574 --> 00:03:17,514
for hours, overruled the director, and even had someone standing by just

57
00:03:17,552 --> 00:03:20,854
holding his personal chocolates in a dish. It was just a horrible,

58
00:03:20,902 --> 00:03:24,774
nightmarish experience, although people have only ever said the opposite

59
00:03:24,822 --> 00:03:28,414
about Steve Buscemi. Buscemi worked as a New York firefighter before

60
00:03:28,452 --> 00:03:31,706
quitting to pursue acting, although when the Twin Towers were destroyed

61
00:03:31,738 --> 00:03:35,214
on September 11, Bushemi walked into his old fire department to

62
00:03:35,252 --> 00:03:38,266
volunteer, working 12 hours a day for a week straight

63
00:03:38,298 --> 00:03:41,822
in the hopes of finding survivors. He called his old firehouse, then,

64
00:03:41,876 --> 00:03:45,462
receiving no reply, headed to the site where he found his form engine

65
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:48,678
company. I asked if I could join them, he said, adding, I could tell they

66
00:03:48,684 --> 00:03:51,798
were a little suspicious at first, but I worked with them that day.

67
00:03:51,884 --> 00:03:54,662
It was a privilege to be able to do it. It was great to connect

68
00:03:54,716 --> 00:03:57,686
with the firehouse I used to work with and with some of the guys I

69
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:01,114
worked alongside. Note this was in 2001, after he was

70
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,022
already extremely famous from movies such as Fargo.

71
00:04:04,086 --> 00:04:07,110
Yet according to an independent article on his volunteering,

72
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,890
very few photographs and no interviews exist because he declined them.

73
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,394
He wasn't there for publicity. Wouldn't you think you were hallucinating if

74
00:04:14,432 --> 00:04:17,758
Steve Buscemi helped you out of the rubble? What a great humble guy.

75
00:04:17,844 --> 00:04:21,134
With a Reddit comment, then offering a slightly more personal story.

76
00:04:21,252 --> 00:04:24,282
I used to serve him all the time and he never once was a diva.

77
00:04:24,346 --> 00:04:27,234
Always had a smile on his face. And, I mean, I Don't even think he

78
00:04:27,272 --> 00:04:30,706
once had a complicated order. He always ordered the most simple thing on

79
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:33,794
the menu and always tipped 20 plus percent. Not to mention,

80
00:04:33,832 --> 00:04:37,390
Bushemi gets extra credit for being close friends with Adam Sandler.

81
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:41,334
However, it seems Jerry Seinfeld was left out of the party. Given every

82
00:04:41,372 --> 00:04:44,994
clip of him I've seen outside of his shows is just him being an unlikable

83
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:48,386
douche with an ego the size of a small country. This sentiment

84
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:51,766
began with a Larry King interview from 2007. I went off

85
00:04:51,788 --> 00:04:54,314
the air. I was the number one show on television. Larry, you were off.

86
00:04:54,352 --> 00:04:57,414
You know who I am? 75 million viewers.

87
00:04:57,542 --> 00:05:01,118
Last episoDe. What? Don't take it so bad.

88
00:05:01,284 --> 00:05:04,734
Well, that's the big difference between being canceled and

89
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:08,362
being number one. Okay, I'm sorry. B movie resume

90
00:05:08,426 --> 00:05:11,946
in here for me. Although this attitude extends

91
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,406
into other moments, like the time he rejected Kesha. I love you so

92
00:05:15,428 --> 00:05:18,754
much. Oh, thanks. No, thanks. Please. No, thanks. A little

93
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:20,020
one? YEAH. No, thanks.

94
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,246
That was a nice moment. I DON'T KnOW WHO THAT WAS. Kesha.

95
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:29,074
OKAY. Jerry then offered no apology for rejecting her. I don't hug

96
00:05:29,122 --> 00:05:32,694
a total stranger. I have to meet someone.

97
00:05:32,812 --> 00:05:36,486
Say hello. I need to know who are you? And she

98
00:05:36,508 --> 00:05:39,278
was very nice about it. We laughed about it. Did you? Yeah. Did you hug

99
00:05:39,314 --> 00:05:42,474
her afterwards? No. Leading Kesha to change her

100
00:05:42,512 --> 00:05:46,138
mind about him for pretty obvious reasons. What happened

101
00:05:46,224 --> 00:05:49,418
with Jerry Seinfeld? Oh, my God.

102
00:05:49,504 --> 00:05:52,426
Are you friends with him? I am not. Okay. Where it goes, it was,

103
00:05:52,448 --> 00:05:56,206
like, the saddest moment of my life. Jerry also has a reputation for

104
00:05:56,228 --> 00:05:59,838
destroying the paparazzi. The worst place, like your bomb. I'm sure comics go

105
00:05:59,844 --> 00:06:03,498
through all the time. Another very weak, weak question. And after Lady

106
00:06:03,514 --> 00:06:06,718
Gaga was moved to his luxury basketball box for acting rudely

107
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:10,290
at a game, he had this to say. This woman's a jerk.

108
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,546
I hate her. I can't believe they put her in my box, which I

109
00:06:14,568 --> 00:06:18,174
paid for. This is what you give people the finger and you get upgraded?

110
00:06:18,222 --> 00:06:21,494
Is that the world we're living in now? Hysterical. I love

111
00:06:21,532 --> 00:06:24,790
him. Jerry Seinfeld's meanness definitely has a charisma to it.

112
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,326
However, if you're wanting a more humble type of charisma, then we have to

113
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:32,646
talk about Post Malone. With entire compilations dedicated to him treating

114
00:06:32,678 --> 00:06:36,026
other people kindly, there are almost too many wholesome moments to

115
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:39,180
choose from. Did you draw this? This is awesome.

116
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:46,238
Thank you. There was that time he went out of

117
00:06:46,244 --> 00:06:49,646
his way to greet a 21 year old having his first beer. Or that time

118
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:53,290
he gave his $5,000 guitar to a fan after a concert.

119
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:57,134
You want a guitar, it's like a $5,000 guitar.

120
00:06:57,182 --> 00:06:59,698
So you have to promise me, you got to promise me that you're going to

121
00:06:59,704 --> 00:07:00,740
take care of it.

122
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,790
Post Malone treats paparazzi in the opposite way to Jerry Seinfeld.

123
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,886
Boss, I want you to know that I really like your music. Thank you so

124
00:07:12,908 --> 00:07:16,882
much, man. Thank you so much. Yeah, that means, can you say hello to Nicole?

125
00:07:17,026 --> 00:07:20,566
Hi, Nicole. Love you guys. And when this fan somehow made it

126
00:07:20,588 --> 00:07:24,362
past security, Post Malone hugs the guy and treats him respectfully before

127
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:28,054
he's taken off the stage. In a different instance, Post Malone let a fan

128
00:07:28,102 --> 00:07:31,546
come on stage to play the guitar part in stay. And it's therefore no

129
00:07:31,568 --> 00:07:34,926
surprise that fans have told anecdotal stories. Such as, someone in

130
00:07:34,948 --> 00:07:38,826
a similar thread said post moved into his brother's street and went and introduced himself

131
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:42,574
to all his new neighbors and invited them for a barbecue. Genuinely sounds

132
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:45,946
like an awesome guy. I believe this 100%. He had a party

133
00:07:45,978 --> 00:07:49,502
in an Airbnb or something a few houses down from my group's Airbnb,

134
00:07:49,566 --> 00:07:52,610
and he legit went around the cul de sac himself, inviting everyone

135
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,934
to the party. He also spent the entire night moving between groups,

136
00:07:55,982 --> 00:07:59,698
chatting, and generally being a phenomenal host and ensuring everyone had a blast.

137
00:07:59,794 --> 00:08:03,074
Ten out of ten, dude. But while nobody has anything negative

138
00:08:03,122 --> 00:08:06,882
to say about post Malone, it seems nobody has anything positive

139
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:10,226
to say about Chevy Chase. Remember when Pete Davidson

140
00:08:10,258 --> 00:08:13,994
praised Adam Sandler earlier in the video? Well, Pete had the opposite to say

141
00:08:14,032 --> 00:08:17,286
about Chevy Chase, stating, he's a fucking douchebag. I hate

142
00:08:17,318 --> 00:08:21,242
that dude. He's just a genuinely bad, racist person and I don't like

143
00:08:21,296 --> 00:08:25,034
him. Chevy Chase was fired from community after calling Donald Glover the N

144
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:28,734
word. Not to mention before the firing, Chase was simply difficult to work

145
00:08:28,772 --> 00:08:32,046
with. He was someone that did not want to be there for the hours that

146
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:35,834
we were keeping. He sometimes could be in not great moods. Earlier in his career,

147
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:39,406
Chevy Chase had gotten into a fistfight with Bill Murray. And while interviewing

148
00:08:39,438 --> 00:08:43,742
Robert Downey Jr. Chase stated, didn't your father used to be a successful director?

149
00:08:43,806 --> 00:08:47,378
Whatever happened to him? Boy, he sure died, you know? He sure went to hell.

150
00:08:47,464 --> 00:08:51,106
It's therefore no surprise that even Will Ferrell stated the worst host

151
00:08:51,138 --> 00:08:54,962
was Chevy Chase. Yet Chevy Chase foolishly claims that all criticism

152
00:08:55,026 --> 00:08:58,802
is just jealousy. Did you just say that writers writing anything negative

153
00:08:58,866 --> 00:09:02,402
is jealousy? Yeah, I did. What kind of jealousy? I'm funnier than them.

154
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:05,866
Yeah, I guess maybe I'm considered good looking. Yeah, there you have it. It seems

155
00:09:05,888 --> 00:09:09,546
Chevy Chase needs a lesson on humility. And who better to teach it than

156
00:09:09,568 --> 00:09:12,950
Shaquille O'Neill? Got to humble yourself. It's all about humility.

157
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:16,334
And that's why I am where I am now. I humbled mysElf. I don't look

158
00:09:16,372 --> 00:09:19,514
down on people because they're lesser. Back in 2011,

159
00:09:19,562 --> 00:09:23,134
Shaq had hit rock bottom. He'd retired from basketball, divorced from his

160
00:09:23,172 --> 00:09:26,810
wife, and had no idea where his life was going next. All's lost.

161
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:30,546
76,000 square foot house by yourself. No kids. Go to

162
00:09:30,568 --> 00:09:33,202
the gym. Nobody's playing in the gym. You go to their room,

163
00:09:33,256 --> 00:09:37,310
nobody's there. It was during this period that Shaq's mom, Lucille, gave him some advice.

164
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:40,806
And then the queen, Dr. Lucille O'Neill, said, hey, man, I don't know you no

165
00:09:40,828 --> 00:09:44,034
more. You need to humble yourself. And when Mama talk, true man listens.

166
00:09:44,082 --> 00:09:47,574
After which, Shaq began working on becoming a better person. It state

167
00:09:47,612 --> 00:09:50,934
the day I killed the narcissist. Shaq is the day my kids texted me,

168
00:09:50,972 --> 00:09:53,990
hey, Daddy, I miss you, bro. When I got one of those texts, man,

169
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,494
I actually cried. Then. I didn't know what to say. After I got that love

170
00:09:57,532 --> 00:10:00,394
from them, I said, you know what? I'm not going to be the asshole Shaq

171
00:10:00,442 --> 00:10:03,646
no more. Because I was an asshole. And I lost everything the day I

172
00:10:03,668 --> 00:10:07,086
released all that. Me. Me, Shaq. Shaq. Shaq. Shaq is the day the

173
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:10,286
blessings opened up. As a result, Shaq's been trying to create a

174
00:10:10,308 --> 00:10:13,694
fairly unique legacy. Talk about legacies. I want mine to be

175
00:10:13,732 --> 00:10:17,326
one sentence. Shaq was a nice guy, which has been aided by his random

176
00:10:17,358 --> 00:10:21,134
acts of kindness, purchasing bikes, shoes, and laptops for less fortunate

177
00:10:21,182 --> 00:10:25,154
children. It seems the only people Shaq won't give money to are his own kids.

178
00:10:25,272 --> 00:10:28,514
Because I believe in respectable nepotism. You get all A's this next

179
00:10:28,552 --> 00:10:31,286
semester. You can get whatever you want. So he gets all A's. And I was

180
00:10:31,308 --> 00:10:34,274
like, go to the dealership and pick one. Then I get a call from Tesla.

181
00:10:34,322 --> 00:10:37,110
I said, man, you better take your ass across the street to Honda.

182
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:41,286
But Walshack is an obvious choice as a nice celebrity. Someone you

183
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:44,746
might not expect to be rude is Bill Nye, the science guy. I met Bill

184
00:10:44,768 --> 00:10:47,946
Nye as a kid, and he was the biggest asshole I've ever met. It was

185
00:10:47,968 --> 00:10:51,526
a huge letdown. After watching his show so often in class. My science

186
00:10:51,558 --> 00:10:54,714
teacher from 7th grade told us she had an explanation for why she

187
00:10:54,752 --> 00:10:58,126
tried to show us as few Bill Nye videos as possible. I believe she said

188
00:10:58,148 --> 00:11:01,738
she attended either a science workshop or an event for teachers where Bill Nye

189
00:11:01,754 --> 00:11:05,166
was there and he was completely rude to her and dismissed her the whole time.

190
00:11:05,268 --> 00:11:08,878
Bill's dark side becomes pretty obvious when he debates other scientists.

191
00:11:08,974 --> 00:11:13,326
However, it seems he becomes the meanest when talking to his most popular demographic,

192
00:11:13,438 --> 00:11:17,390
kids Bill Nye came to visit my university. I was sorely disappointed.

193
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,546
Bill Nye relied on sexist jokes to relate to the crowd. He kept

194
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:23,862
complimenting women's legs and saying weird stuff about how sexy women

195
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:27,666
are. He was trying to be relatable, but was sorely mistaken as he faced

196
00:11:27,698 --> 00:11:31,734
a crowd of driven female engineers and scientists. He went on about climate change

197
00:11:31,772 --> 00:11:35,226
and basically insinuated that we could be the policy changes while

198
00:11:35,248 --> 00:11:38,826
the real scientists did the real work. I couldn't believe how much my views of

199
00:11:38,848 --> 00:11:42,326
him were falling apart as I watched him pander to students he clearly didn't

200
00:11:42,358 --> 00:11:46,170
care about. I later heard that he wouldn't speak with students, only professors,

201
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,646
with this anecdote, following the very common theme of Bill Nye was my

202
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:53,486
hero until I heard him talk. Although thankfully Keanu Reeves is

203
00:11:53,508 --> 00:11:56,866
the perfect balance between good and evil. While filming the

204
00:11:56,888 --> 00:12:00,562
second two Matrix movies, Keanu Reeves chose to give up 75

205
00:12:00,616 --> 00:12:04,098
million worth of his movie earnings, instead redirecting the money to

206
00:12:04,104 --> 00:12:07,426
the special effects team, who he said deserved it more. Even then,

207
00:12:07,448 --> 00:12:11,186
this might not have been his most charitable act whilst filming. As a Reddit user

208
00:12:11,218 --> 00:12:14,326
stated, a family friend Builds movie sets, doesn't design,

209
00:12:14,428 --> 00:12:17,846
is one of the poor dudes that just builds. Anyways, he worked on the set

210
00:12:17,868 --> 00:12:21,766
for the Matrix and Keanu heard about family trouble he was having and gave him

211
00:12:21,788 --> 00:12:25,706
a $20,000 Christmas bonus to help him out. Although money isn't the

212
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:29,046
only thing that Keanu has given up. In 2011, he was candidly

213
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:32,586
filmed giving up his seat on the New York subway, and three years later in

214
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:35,726
2014, he waited patiently for 20 minutes in the

215
00:12:35,748 --> 00:12:39,406
rain outside the rap party of his own film Daughter of God.

216
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:42,906
After a mix up because he didn't want to cause a scene, he didn't

217
00:12:42,938 --> 00:12:46,398
say hey, I'm Keanu Reeves or Yo man, this is my party. Once to

218
00:12:46,404 --> 00:12:50,158
the bouncer and the owner of the club was horrified when he found out afterwards

219
00:12:50,254 --> 00:12:54,066
that the actor was standing in the rain. It's therefore no surprise that there's an

220
00:12:54,088 --> 00:12:58,134
extremely popular subreddit dedicated to Keanu Reeves being awesome.

221
00:12:58,252 --> 00:13:02,018
Although if there's one person who could offset this kindness with meanness,

222
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:05,334
it's definitely Ellen DeGeneres right now, we all need

223
00:13:05,372 --> 00:13:08,710
a little kindness. You know, like Ellen DeGeneres always talks about,

224
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,506
she's also notoriously one of the meanest people alive. Respond to

225
00:13:12,528 --> 00:13:15,610
this with the most insane stories you've heard about Ellen being mean,

226
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,626
and I'll match everyone with $2 to LA Food Bank. This was the tweet that

227
00:13:19,648 --> 00:13:22,986
started her downfall, as nobody could have expected how bad the

228
00:13:23,008 --> 00:13:26,890
responses would be. When I was 15, the Ellen show was doing a contest.

229
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:30,286
A fan's making a bust of her and sending it to her. I worked so

230
00:13:30,308 --> 00:13:33,566
hard on this and even wrote her a letter. Weeks later. She used it as

231
00:13:33,588 --> 00:13:37,582
a prop in a game and gave it away to a random person with $500

232
00:13:37,636 --> 00:13:41,106
attached to the bottom. Working for her, I was instructed that I can't look her

233
00:13:41,128 --> 00:13:44,574
in the eye and never, ever say hi to her first. But don't worry,

234
00:13:44,622 --> 00:13:47,986
she definitely won't be saying hi to you in the first place. She creates the

235
00:13:48,008 --> 00:13:51,714
most toxic environment for her staff. I worked at real food daily,

236
00:13:51,762 --> 00:13:55,266
served her and Portia at brunch. She wrote a letter to the owner and complained

237
00:13:55,298 --> 00:13:58,646
about my chipped nail polish. Not that it was on her plate, but just that

238
00:13:58,668 --> 00:14:01,706
it was on my hand. I'd worked till closing the night before,

239
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:05,334
and this was the next morning. Almost got me fired. Chris Pontier

240
00:14:05,382 --> 00:14:09,350
stated on Steve O's podcast that he wasn't surprised to hear these anecdotes.

241
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:12,602
It's crazy that all this stuff's come out, like, about Ellen being mean,

242
00:14:12,656 --> 00:14:15,406
because when I met her, I thought she was really mean. And she's like,

243
00:14:15,428 --> 00:14:17,774
so what do I got to do? And she's just pissed to be there.

244
00:14:17,812 --> 00:14:21,150
And then she comes out on stage and she's like all like, funny, nice Ellen,

245
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:25,566
the person that they think she is. And appareNtly, neither were the ten employees

246
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:29,250
who came forward four months later to expose her terrible working

247
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,786
environment. Toxic. Phony. Hypocrite. Liar. That's what

248
00:14:32,808 --> 00:14:35,982
she is. We were told from the very beginning, don't talk to Ellen.

249
00:14:36,046 --> 00:14:39,746
Don't do this. You can't go into her office. It was very nerve wracking,

250
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:43,222
very stressful. We all walked on eggshells all the time. As a result,

251
00:14:43,276 --> 00:14:47,410
Ellen took a 14 week hiatus, returning with a pretty standard apology.

252
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,722
Sometimes I get sad, I get mad, I get anxious,

253
00:14:50,786 --> 00:14:54,694
I get frustrated, I get impatient, and I am working on

254
00:14:54,732 --> 00:14:58,018
all of that. However, this failed to ensure a returning audience,

255
00:14:58,114 --> 00:15:01,260
as in May 2022, and show was canceled completely.
