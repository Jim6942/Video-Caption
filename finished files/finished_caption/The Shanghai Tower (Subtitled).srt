1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,426
Rising majestically from one of the busiest cities on Earth, the Shanghai Tower

2
00:00:04,458 --> 00:00:07,642
is an iconic piece of Chinese architecture. With its twisting,

3
00:00:07,706 --> 00:00:11,438
sleek silhouette, this colossal masterpiece stands as a

4
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:15,626
testament to human ingenuity and takes its rifle place as one of only four skyscrapers

5
00:00:15,658 --> 00:00:18,734
on earth that is classified as mega tall. Today,

6
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,566
we're going to cover everything there is to know about the tallest building in all

7
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:25,506
of Asia, including the problems faced during construction, how it manages to meld cutting edge

8
00:00:25,538 --> 00:00:28,646
technology with breathtaking design, and the debate about whether or not the

9
00:00:28,668 --> 00:00:32,120
entire project was actually worth it at all.

10
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,322
Now, Shanghai is one of the largest cities in the entire

11
00:00:49,376 --> 00:00:53,030
world, boasting an estimated population in excess of 25 million

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,242
people. Near the center of this enormous city lies the Luzhou Financial

13
00:00:57,306 --> 00:01:00,718
District, right on the edge of the Hangpu River. For much of

14
00:01:00,724 --> 00:01:04,538
its modern history, this area was a relatively undeveloped region. But beginning

15
00:01:04,554 --> 00:01:07,810
in the 1980s, the government designated the district as a special

16
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,990
investment zone, and development was rapid.

17
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,466
By the 1990s, city planners had settled on the idea that this area would

18
00:01:14,488 --> 00:01:18,334
feature three noteworthy skyscrapers to create a unique skyline

19
00:01:18,382 --> 00:01:21,878
that would attract tourists and businesses. Two of these skyscrapers were finished by the

20
00:01:21,884 --> 00:01:25,554
early two thousand s. That being the Shanghai World Financial center and the Jing

21
00:01:25,602 --> 00:01:28,614
Mao Tower. These buildings were impressive buildings on their own.

22
00:01:28,652 --> 00:01:32,534
But the third and final skyscraper, the Shanghai Tower, would steal

23
00:01:32,662 --> 00:01:36,106
the show. In 2006, the Shanghai Municipal government began an

24
00:01:36,128 --> 00:01:39,626
international bid for whichever company wanted to head up the project. And right off the

25
00:01:39,648 --> 00:01:42,346
bat, it was clear that the bidders had their work cut out for them.

26
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:45,498
The designers wanted the tower to be the tallest building in Asia, shooting for taller

27
00:01:45,514 --> 00:01:49,482
than 600 meters. Its style needed to match the feel of its neighboring buildings.

28
00:01:49,546 --> 00:01:52,814
But at the same time, it also needed to stand out from them.

29
00:01:52,852 --> 00:01:56,254
Aesthetics aside, there were dozens of technical issues to solve,

30
00:01:56,302 --> 00:01:59,710
like the foundation, wind resistance, and economic feasibility.

31
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,646
Of the 19 tower proposals, the winning design was from the American architectural

32
00:02:03,678 --> 00:02:07,310
firm Genzler. And after a couple of years planning and preparing construction began

33
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,302
in November of 2008. The first hurdle faced by the team was the soft

34
00:02:11,356 --> 00:02:14,966
soil underneath Shanghai. An ordinary foundation wouldn't suffice here

35
00:02:14,988 --> 00:02:19,286
for a tower that would eventually weigh more than 850,000

36
00:02:19,388 --> 00:02:23,018
tons, as it would be incredibly unstable and especially

37
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:26,378
prone to seismic activity. Fears of the soil problem intensified just a

38
00:02:26,384 --> 00:02:29,546
few months into construction, when a nearby apartment complex collapsed as

39
00:02:29,568 --> 00:02:33,506
its foundation failed to hold the building steady. During an adjacent construction

40
00:02:33,558 --> 00:02:36,862
project, apparently, digging crews had dug dirt out of one side

41
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:40,654
and piled it up on the surface, creating a pressure difference that the foundation just

42
00:02:40,692 --> 00:02:43,854
simply couldn't handle. Fortunately, the apartments were empty when this happened.

43
00:02:43,892 --> 00:02:47,186
And so it didn't really make headlines around the world. But a failure in the

44
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,386
Shanghai Tower absolutely would. And with

45
00:02:50,408 --> 00:02:54,738
a building of this size, a collapse would just be nothing short of

46
00:02:54,824 --> 00:02:58,478
super. Gao Garong, a geotechnical expert overseeing

47
00:02:58,494 --> 00:03:01,586
the project, stated that if the proper steps weren't taken to secure the Shanghai

48
00:03:01,618 --> 00:03:04,806
Tower, the damages could be irreparable. It could cause a

49
00:03:04,828 --> 00:03:08,690
power failure, or sinkholes, leading to the sinking of neighboring buildings.

50
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,842
The consequences are unimaginable. There simply can be no

51
00:03:12,896 --> 00:03:16,154
mistakes. The solution to the foundation issue was threefold. First,

52
00:03:16,192 --> 00:03:19,546
the team distributed the weight of the tower across a much wider base of

53
00:03:19,568 --> 00:03:23,146
reinforced concrete to spread out the force that it exerts on the soil.

54
00:03:23,178 --> 00:03:27,242
And second, underneath the main foundation would be concrete pylons,

55
00:03:27,306 --> 00:03:30,382
extending deep into the ground, providing significantly more

56
00:03:30,436 --> 00:03:34,266
strength to the overall structure. About 1000 of these pylons

57
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:38,002
would ultimately be necessary. Finally, to make absolutely certain

58
00:03:38,056 --> 00:03:41,698
that the building would be stable, the engineers decided that five entire

59
00:03:41,784 --> 00:03:44,958
floors of the building would be undergrounD. To accommodate these five levels,

60
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:48,734
along with a foundation, the first step of construction was to dig a massive

61
00:03:48,782 --> 00:03:52,514
pit measuring 121 meters across and 33 meters deep.

62
00:03:52,562 --> 00:03:56,214
The concrete for the main portion of the massive foundation was then poured, and all

63
00:03:56,252 --> 00:03:59,846
within three days. And by 2010, everyone was prepared to

64
00:03:59,868 --> 00:04:03,354
begin construction on the main portion of the tower. The first step was to bring

65
00:04:03,392 --> 00:04:06,906
up the core of the skyscraper, made of reinforced concrete. This was

66
00:04:06,928 --> 00:04:11,094
done using what's called a slip forming process, meaning that all the machines

67
00:04:11,142 --> 00:04:14,794
and equipment needed to create a floor are housed within a giant steel

68
00:04:14,842 --> 00:04:18,574
platform weighing 1000 tons, which is then raised, little by

69
00:04:18,612 --> 00:04:22,126
little, moving up after each floor is finished. It took

70
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:25,966
six whole hours to raise this massive platform to the next level. But it was

71
00:04:25,988 --> 00:04:29,698
worth the wait for the safety and convenience that it provided. A special type of

72
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:33,102
concrete, called self compacting concrete, used for its high fluidity,

73
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:36,766
is pumped through a network of pipes up to the platform, where workers

74
00:04:36,798 --> 00:04:40,418
then pour it into place. Throughout the months, the crew worked at an average speed

75
00:04:40,434 --> 00:04:44,226
of one floor every five days, slowly raising themselves up into the clouds,

76
00:04:44,258 --> 00:04:48,050
as the bones of the tower began to emerge into the Shanghai skyline.

77
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:51,414
Soon enough, it had surpassed the towers next to it, and by June 2014,

78
00:04:51,462 --> 00:04:55,286
the building had reached its final height. And the crown structure was placed

79
00:04:55,318 --> 00:04:58,774
on the very top, followed by the glass facade down its sides.

80
00:04:58,822 --> 00:05:01,946
And then the interior design. Everything was finished,

81
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:04,720
and the tower opened to the public in February of 2015.

82
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:13,134
Now, the Shanghai Tower dominates its skyline. Coming in at

83
00:05:13,172 --> 00:05:16,490
632 meters tall, or about 2073ft,

84
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,842
this makes it the tallest building in China, the second tallest building in the world.

85
00:05:19,896 --> 00:05:23,614
And not only is it known for its height, but also for its elegant spiral

86
00:05:23,662 --> 00:05:27,338
design and its glass twisting 120 degrees as it rises.

87
00:05:27,454 --> 00:05:31,570
This look was achieved by dividing the core into nine distinct sections,

88
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,218
each slightly rotated from the previous, giving it its natural twisting appearance.

89
00:05:35,314 --> 00:05:38,694
OriGinally, the designers wanted this spiraling to be even more

90
00:05:38,732 --> 00:05:42,394
dramatic, originally envisioned as more of a whirlpool, but this

91
00:05:42,432 --> 00:05:46,202
was adapted into the current version due to structural concerns. While it does

92
00:05:46,256 --> 00:05:49,626
look impressive, the design isn't just for aesthetic reasons. A V

93
00:05:49,648 --> 00:05:52,822
shaped indent known as a strike soars up the side of the tower,

94
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:56,286
which, along with the overall shape, reduces the impact of wind by as

95
00:05:56,308 --> 00:05:59,466
much as 25% compared to a rectangular tower, which Genzler

96
00:05:59,498 --> 00:06:02,922
estimates saved them as much as $58 million in construction materials.

97
00:06:02,986 --> 00:06:06,446
Now, one of the most striking features of the tower is the glass facade that's

98
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,002
double paned, with considerable space between the inner and outer layers. This extra

99
00:06:10,056 --> 00:06:13,982
space between the glass panes provides two main benefits. First is environmental.

100
00:06:14,046 --> 00:06:17,934
Most skyscrapers use a single layer of glass, which is highly opaque and reflective,

101
00:06:17,982 --> 00:06:21,090
in order to reduce heat absorption. But by having two layers,

102
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:24,882
the Shanghai Tower takes away the need for either of them to be reflective,

103
00:06:24,946 --> 00:06:28,486
creating a heat buffer zone that simultaneously allows loads of

104
00:06:28,508 --> 00:06:31,834
natural light to pour into the offices while also reducing the power needed

105
00:06:31,872 --> 00:06:35,606
for air conditioning. In many of these buffer zones, or atria, hanging gardens

106
00:06:35,638 --> 00:06:38,934
have been created. This sustainability, along with others, such as numerous

107
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:42,538
built in wind turbines and a system for catching and reusing rainwater, has earned the

108
00:06:42,544 --> 00:06:46,122
Shanghai Tower platinum certification from the leadership in Energy and environmental

109
00:06:46,186 --> 00:06:49,534
design, or lead the tallest building to have ever received such

110
00:06:49,572 --> 00:06:53,134
an award. The second benefit from these glass panes is the creation of

111
00:06:53,172 --> 00:06:56,786
public spaces in a glass atrium not already taken up by green space.

112
00:06:56,888 --> 00:07:00,386
One can find restaurants, retail stores, cafes, walking paths and much

113
00:07:00,408 --> 00:07:03,726
more, all accompanied by panoramic views of the city. And aside

114
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:06,978
from these public spaces, there are many more things for visitors to see and experience.

115
00:07:07,064 --> 00:07:10,966
The first cell encounter are the tower's many elevators, which are the second fastest in

116
00:07:10,988 --> 00:07:14,598
the entire world. Built by Mitsubishi, these elevators can race from the

117
00:07:14,604 --> 00:07:18,534
second basement level to the 119th floor in just 53

118
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:22,102
seconds. And a fun side note, I've done it, and it's very

119
00:07:22,156 --> 00:07:26,026
quick. They reach a maximum speed of 74.

120
00:07:26,048 --> 00:07:28,438
After you're launched to the upper floors of the tower, you can step out onto

121
00:07:28,454 --> 00:07:32,454
the observation deck, which is tied for highest on the planet at 562 meters

122
00:07:32,502 --> 00:07:36,394
or 1843ft. It's certainly an impressive structure,

123
00:07:36,442 --> 00:07:39,726
and according to one of the lead architects, it paves the way for redefining how

124
00:07:39,748 --> 00:07:42,954
tall buildings are used in big cities. The designers spoke

125
00:07:43,002 --> 00:07:46,846
of envisioning a future where all skyscrapers have these large public spaces

126
00:07:46,878 --> 00:07:50,366
and boost the life of the city, instead of just being a dark

127
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:54,002
corporate tower. Now, all this sounds wonderful, but whether or not

128
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:58,006
it's even been achieved in the Shanghai Tower is actually open for debate. And it

129
00:07:58,028 --> 00:08:02,066
all comes down to the immense cost of construction

130
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:03,350
and maintenance.

131
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,818
Now, the final cost for the Shanghai Tower was estimated at $2.4

132
00:08:11,904 --> 00:08:15,386
billion, quite a hefty price tag, but one that was expected to pay

133
00:08:15,408 --> 00:08:19,018
itself off through an influx of businesses. To the new officers, however,

134
00:08:19,104 --> 00:08:22,410
this anticipated rush of corporations never really happened.

135
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,946
In 2017, the tower management announced they were actually struggling to rent

136
00:08:25,978 --> 00:08:29,354
out the spaces because it had still failed to obtain all the necessary

137
00:08:29,402 --> 00:08:32,702
permits from the fire department. Because of this, prospective tenants stayed away,

138
00:08:32,756 --> 00:08:36,090
and even a large percentage of those that were actively paying for rooms

139
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:39,822
had yet to move into them. Another problem was that although the spiraling glass facade

140
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:43,806
certainly makes it look really cool, it had the unintentional effect of creating lots

141
00:08:43,838 --> 00:08:47,954
of floor space, especially odly shaped edges and corners that were

142
00:08:47,992 --> 00:08:51,494
entirely unusable, making companies hesitant to pay for space that they couldn't even

143
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:55,650
utilize. On top of this, the lead Platinum certification is an architect's dream,

144
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,074
but its increased efficiency also means higher cost for renters,

145
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:02,614
pushing away even more customers. As of 2019, 50 fire floors

146
00:09:02,662 --> 00:09:06,202
were completely empty, a problem painfully obvious to the world at night,

147
00:09:06,256 --> 00:09:09,786
when more than half of the tower was dark. This problem was only

148
00:09:09,808 --> 00:09:13,514
exacerbated by the worldwide shutdowns a year later. 2020 saw yet another

149
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:17,626
problem for the building, which was widespread water leaks between the 9th and 60th floors,

150
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:20,794
damaging carpets, desks and a whole lot of electronics.

151
00:09:20,842 --> 00:09:24,238
This caused many on Chinese social media platforms to add the Shanghai Tower to the

152
00:09:24,244 --> 00:09:27,246
so called Tofu dreg construction projects,

153
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:30,686
or simply tofu buildings. Tofu buildings are the slang term

154
00:09:30,718 --> 00:09:34,066
the construction of Chinese buildings of incredibly poor quality, often as

155
00:09:34,088 --> 00:09:37,954
a result of speedy work, lackluster materials, or money skimmed by

156
00:09:37,992 --> 00:09:41,746
corrupt officials. Management of the Shanghai Tower was quick to dispel these rumors,

157
00:09:41,778 --> 00:09:45,286
and to point out that many viral videos of ceilings collapsing were actually from a

158
00:09:45,308 --> 00:09:48,786
shopping center across the country from 2016. But the water damage

159
00:09:48,898 --> 00:09:52,486
was real, and inspection teams had to be called in to investigate

160
00:09:52,518 --> 00:09:56,726
the source. And once that had been fixed, there was still untold damage across dozens

161
00:09:56,758 --> 00:10:00,246
of floors, as if they already didn't have an issue attracting

162
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:03,606
tenants. And so, despite being one of the most impressive buildings

163
00:10:03,638 --> 00:10:07,082
of the 21st century. Having pushed the limits of engineering and innovating

164
00:10:07,146 --> 00:10:10,398
several methods of construction, the Shanghai Tower is often considered by many to

165
00:10:10,404 --> 00:10:14,122
be a failure. Keep in mind that it was originally designed to signify

166
00:10:14,186 --> 00:10:17,314
the exploding success of the Chinese economy. But with its many

167
00:10:17,352 --> 00:10:21,074
empty offices and its many dark floors, perhaps it has become an

168
00:10:21,112 --> 00:10:24,786
ironic symbol of economic shortfalls. As one analyst put

169
00:10:24,808 --> 00:10:28,402
it, no company on earth could afford to fund such a project and never

170
00:10:28,456 --> 00:10:31,846
make their money back. Only large governments have the spare cash for

171
00:10:31,868 --> 00:10:35,302
that, and it doesn't seem that China will be making a significant return

172
00:10:35,356 --> 00:10:39,698
on their investment anytime soon. But the story's not over for the twisting skyscraper.

173
00:10:39,794 --> 00:10:43,174
So in the coming years, if prices change, or if new incentives attract more

174
00:10:43,212 --> 00:10:46,726
companies, the Shanghai Tower could transform into a new financial hub for

175
00:10:46,748 --> 00:10:50,490
China and East Asia as a whole. But only time hotel.
