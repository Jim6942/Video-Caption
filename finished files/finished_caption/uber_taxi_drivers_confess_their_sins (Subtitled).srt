00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,626
Hello. It is time for this week's. Yeah, yeah, you can relate.

2
00:00:03,658 --> 00:00:06,762
You've cut a cab before, right? You little sobs.

3
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:10,762
Taxi drivers confess their sins, and we realized

4
00:00:10,826 --> 00:00:14,506
halfway through that it's not actually that relatable because no one catches taxis anymore.

5
00:00:14,618 --> 00:00:18,414
Unless maybe you're a grandma. I don't know. But everyone seems to catch this

6
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:22,222
new Uber, as it's called. So we also had to do a

7
00:00:22,276 --> 00:00:25,794
rare two for one here. Taxi. Uber drivers confess

8
00:00:25,842 --> 00:00:29,526
their sins and you know, they will be mighty. You know those little

9
00:00:29,548 --> 00:00:33,574
sons of bitches that give you free lollies are going to be. Let's find out

10
00:00:33,612 --> 00:00:34,200
together.

11
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,758
Let's get into it. Very excited to do it for this one. This is

12
00:00:40,844 --> 00:00:44,074
obviously a bunch of stories that we have collected from you that I've never seen

13
00:00:44,112 --> 00:00:47,386
before, so that we all have fun together and make sure

14
00:00:47,408 --> 00:00:50,538
that you put in your comments of what we asked you to

15
00:00:50,544 --> 00:00:53,350
do at the end of this video, which I also can't remember. So we are

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,894
going to go into the comments there. Second drive from my first

17
00:00:56,932 --> 00:01:00,814
night driving as an Uber. I didn't know that your soul got

18
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:03,410
sucked into the app. You're an Uber now.

19
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,460
Picked up a literal goblin from the city.

20
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,406
He was sweaty or excreted. Green liquid.

21
00:01:11,518 --> 00:01:14,866
Was he? Is that humanly possible? I suppose you

22
00:01:14,888 --> 00:01:19,110
would have to be a goblin. Yeah, the story does check out and smelled similar

23
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,870
to what I imagined. The inside of an illegal sperm bank.

24
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,366
This is amazing. It's like the most blue collar jobs

25
00:01:29,398 --> 00:01:33,146
we've done have been the most descriptive. Except mechanics. You were all

26
00:01:33,168 --> 00:01:37,718
a bunch of dumb, but they'd

27
00:01:37,734 --> 00:01:40,986
like that regardless. Quick ten minute drive. I wonder where he

28
00:01:41,008 --> 00:01:43,994
wanted to go. Green Gotch, please. Four minutes in,

29
00:01:44,112 --> 00:01:47,806
he began. Nothing. A quick one out. Jesus, I wonder. He smelled like

30
00:01:47,828 --> 00:01:51,214
a sperm bacon. It couldn't even last five minutes. It's the Simpsons line of

31
00:01:51,252 --> 00:01:54,400
can't you go 5 seconds without jacking up?

32
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:58,180
How long was that when I asked him what he was doing?

33
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,726
Jesus, you really need those five star reviews,

34
00:02:01,758 --> 00:02:05,702
don't you? Excuse me, I can't help but notice that you're trying to

35
00:02:05,756 --> 00:02:08,902
ejaculate on the back of my head. When I asked him what he was doing,

36
00:02:08,956 --> 00:02:12,722
he just snarled and continued,

37
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:16,870
confirmed Goblin. Isn't that an amazing response?

38
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,970
When I got to the destination, he moaned,

39
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,394
he's giving you that five star. And just got

40
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:30,038
out without either of us exchanging any

41
00:02:30,144 --> 00:02:33,120
words. He didn't say any words the whole time.

42
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,142
Glad he didn't ask to sit in the front. Wouldn't have been worth

43
00:02:38,196 --> 00:02:42,094
the $8, but in

44
00:02:42,132 --> 00:02:46,558
the back. Money well earned. I was out driving for Uber

45
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:50,354
and pull up to this house. Passenger jumps in, chat for a bit.

46
00:02:50,472 --> 00:02:53,662
Taking him to the airport. Now, this is in Rockhampton,

47
00:02:53,726 --> 00:02:57,778
Queensland, and he was very

48
00:02:57,864 --> 00:03:00,582
insistent on getting there ASAP. Anyway,

49
00:03:00,716 --> 00:03:03,702
drop him off, none the wiser. About a week later,

50
00:03:03,756 --> 00:03:07,222
I get a call from the police asking about a customer I had taken

51
00:03:07,276 --> 00:03:11,578
to the airport. Turns out it was Matthew Cox who

52
00:03:11,664 --> 00:03:14,826
murdered his wife and was on the run from the

53
00:03:14,848 --> 00:03:18,682
police. Isn't it amazing that you had

54
00:03:18,736 --> 00:03:21,850
General Chat with Matthew Cox?

55
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:26,102
What are you talking about? You watch that new serial killer documentary?

56
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:29,406
No, that stuff's too gory for me. I don't know why we

57
00:03:29,428 --> 00:03:31,998
cut to a photo of him. I could have acted that character out. Look at

58
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:35,086
him. Identical. Just put up a comparison shot. I should

59
00:03:35,108 --> 00:03:38,974
be one of those guys in the lineup. Turn to your left. I was promised

60
00:03:39,022 --> 00:03:42,594
a coffee. A gaggle of uni girls hopped in the back of my car.

61
00:03:42,632 --> 00:03:45,366
I didn't know that that's what that group was called. There you go. The more

62
00:03:45,388 --> 00:03:49,350
you know they were causing the usual post pre drink ruckus.

63
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,750
Pretty standard. Oh, we're all aware of what that gaggle sounds

64
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,014
like. Turn it up.

65
00:03:57,132 --> 00:04:00,714
Turn it up, driver. I'm getting post

66
00:04:00,752 --> 00:04:04,566
traumatic stress. I never even had your job. All of a sudden,

67
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:08,250
I heard one of them make a noise akin to a sneeze.

68
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,778
I asked, all good back there? They replied, yeah, she gets

69
00:04:12,864 --> 00:04:16,394
calved. Dropped them off, went to go get the next passengers,

70
00:04:16,442 --> 00:04:20,538
a young couple who had informed me that there was a small vodka cruiser,

71
00:04:20,714 --> 00:04:24,994
bile puddle on

72
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:29,342
my backseat. She just coughed.

73
00:04:29,406 --> 00:04:33,026
Fuck off. Although it was set up, by the

74
00:04:33,048 --> 00:04:36,330
way. I offered a couple of spot up the front and they're

75
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,526
like, nah, we'll manage, man. How much nicer are

76
00:04:39,548 --> 00:04:42,438
they than the gaggle? It's a 15 minutes drive,

77
00:04:42,524 --> 00:04:46,854
so I think Nothing of it. About five minutes in

78
00:04:46,972 --> 00:04:49,814
to the drive, I hear slurping.

79
00:04:49,942 --> 00:04:53,674
No, I say jokingly, you're not spewing too,

80
00:04:53,712 --> 00:04:57,702
are you? No. Turns out they decide

81
00:04:57,766 --> 00:05:04,254
the best place to give the bloke a

82
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:08,186
gobby was my vomit soaked back seat.

83
00:05:08,298 --> 00:05:11,326
Well, at least we know there's one man that would approve the goblin from the

84
00:05:11,348 --> 00:05:14,626
first story. This series sucks. All the stories are time,

85
00:05:14,728 --> 00:05:18,340
nothing. To get my rocks up. I told them to stop,

86
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,140
to which the bloke said, oh, come on, man.

87
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,134
It's a horror short story. Your comment

88
00:05:27,182 --> 00:05:30,438
should be sold at Dimmick so a bunch of 15 year olds can

89
00:05:30,444 --> 00:05:33,958
get it from their auntie and go yeah, thanks. I simply said,

90
00:05:34,124 --> 00:05:37,510
would you want to clean up? Come and vomit.

91
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:41,434
He zipped it up immediately. Brisbane is

92
00:05:41,472 --> 00:05:45,958
fucked. You're right. I've been a terrible backseat passenger.

93
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:49,654
One time when I was driving Uber for a dude, took out a staple

94
00:05:49,702 --> 00:05:53,622
gun in the back of my car and proceeded to staple his pants

95
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:57,022
to my car seat. It's a different one, I'll give him that. And I've always

96
00:05:57,076 --> 00:06:00,526
wondered, what the fuck are staples even used for these days? Now we

97
00:06:00,548 --> 00:06:04,382
know. When I called the cops, he just started screaming about

98
00:06:04,436 --> 00:06:07,886
how I was trying to kill him and then demanded

99
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,410
I pull over. And when I did, he jumped out of my car,

100
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,850
leaving the nail gun and a small amount of his pants

101
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:18,530
and just tore up and stayed in the back of the seat.

102
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,686
Dude. Dude. If I could, I would

103
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:25,046
put as much effort as I did into interviewing Kevin Rudd for

104
00:06:25,068 --> 00:06:28,726
the first time to just sit him down in an expensive hotel room

105
00:06:28,828 --> 00:06:31,850
just to. So just walk us through that.

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,450
What was going on in your head? I wasn't attaching myself to the car.

107
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,380
I was attaching a car to me.

108
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,634
Became the car. Fuck me. And I don't know. No idea

109
00:06:42,672 --> 00:06:45,466
what happened to him, but I pawned off the staple gun for, like, $20.

110
00:06:45,578 --> 00:06:48,734
So that'll help pay for the new seat cushion, I guess.

111
00:06:48,852 --> 00:06:54,682
Yeah. Was $1,500. Now only $1,480.

112
00:06:54,746 --> 00:06:58,494
It's true what they say. Office work saves you money. Don't personally

113
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:02,114
drive, but I work the phones. Oh, you're like that guy in

114
00:07:02,152 --> 00:07:05,634
that 70s show. That's not called that 70 show,

115
00:07:05,672 --> 00:07:09,486
but is a sitcom. Taxi. Yeah, that's the one. A driver

116
00:07:09,518 --> 00:07:12,566
once got asked to take a guy to a brothel, wait outside and take him

117
00:07:12,588 --> 00:07:15,958
home. I thought that'd be, like 50% affairs. Old mate comes out

118
00:07:16,044 --> 00:07:19,850
about half an hour later, quite pissed off, and demands to be taken to a

119
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,942
better brothel. About $600 worth of driving around to various

120
00:07:24,006 --> 00:07:27,574
establishments with similar results. What a picky,

121
00:07:27,622 --> 00:07:30,986
horny man. He finally drunkenly asked to

122
00:07:31,008 --> 00:07:34,558
be taken home, and when they got there, he tried to pay the

123
00:07:34,564 --> 00:07:38,186
driver another thousand dollars to come inside and stay the night. The driver

124
00:07:38,218 --> 00:07:40,320
was into his 70s.

125
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,314
How do you go to every brothel in the city

126
00:07:45,352 --> 00:07:48,850
and just be like, filth? No good stock in the entire

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,700
city.

128
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,846
I talked too soon. I was driving taxis in Adelaide

129
00:07:56,878 --> 00:08:00,914
in 1996 to pay for uni. That's sick. How Ryan

130
00:08:00,962 --> 00:08:04,454
Gosling is that? One of his characters, not him. He has a much better life

131
00:08:04,492 --> 00:08:08,674
than that. I drive to the airport, mostly taxi

132
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:12,326
driver. Oh, wait, that's already a movie on a Saturday night

133
00:08:12,428 --> 00:08:15,994
slash Sunday morning shift. Yeah, they're fucked hours, aren't they?

134
00:08:16,032 --> 00:08:20,060
No one should be working when literally everyone else on earth is having fun.

135
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:24,430
Fredley Jordy's discovers the service industry and

136
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,934
laughs at it. Fuck. I had a real YouTuber out

137
00:08:27,972 --> 00:08:31,070
of touch moment then, didn't I? What?

138
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,182
50% of jobs in society propping up the other 50%

139
00:08:35,236 --> 00:08:38,578
of rich having fun? Why would you do that?

140
00:08:38,664 --> 00:08:42,146
I was over at a radio job taking someone from a suburb to

141
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:45,566
the airport at 04:30 a.m. There's so many of you cabbies,

142
00:08:45,598 --> 00:08:49,080
isn't there? There's so many cabbies on AM radio sitting there.

143
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,950
No, it's a thing.

144
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,110
A radio job is just their radio.

145
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,240
Oh, right.

146
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,498
This is so amazing. I'm so removed from society that I

147
00:09:03,504 --> 00:09:07,766
can't even read comments about people that are in society anymore.

148
00:09:07,878 --> 00:09:11,246
Oh, something I can relate to. A job in the media.

149
00:09:11,348 --> 00:09:13,578
A. What was the starting salary?

150
00:09:13,674 --> 00:09:16,830
5600 grand. Now, where were we?

151
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,682
Is misinterpreting this man's shit

152
00:09:20,746 --> 00:09:24,450
life with a layer of exuberance.

153
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:30,034
Let's continue, shall we? From the end of the cul de sac, I was

154
00:09:30,072 --> 00:09:33,586
offering my figure over the accept button. Considering whether to

155
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:37,174
ignore my gut instincts about the job, it was accepted by

156
00:09:37,212 --> 00:09:40,326
another taxi. So I went about my normal Sunday morning,

157
00:09:40,428 --> 00:09:43,000
trawling for drunks in the city.

158
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,106
What a sentence. What a sentence. And what a king.

159
00:09:49,218 --> 00:09:52,934
That's Australia's version of world's deadliest catch. When I got back

160
00:09:52,972 --> 00:09:56,554
to the taxi depot at 06:00 a.m. Shift and the building was crawling with cop

161
00:09:56,592 --> 00:09:59,866
cars, the guy who took the radio job instead of me had been called to

162
00:09:59,888 --> 00:10:03,390
an unoccupied address. Resident away on holiday

163
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:08,414
was ambushed and shot dead with

164
00:10:08,452 --> 00:10:12,042
a heavy caliber handgun. No robbery

165
00:10:12,106 --> 00:10:16,110
involved. His car and cash apparently

166
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,090
left untucked. What the fuck?

167
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,678
Just a straight up Jesus

168
00:10:23,774 --> 00:10:27,634
Christ. So it wasn't a radio job. The taxi

169
00:10:27,682 --> 00:10:31,026
request was a meticulously planned setup

170
00:10:31,058 --> 00:10:34,214
for what other cabbies presumed to be, or had heard

171
00:10:34,332 --> 00:10:38,022
on the grapevine to have been part of a gang

172
00:10:38,086 --> 00:10:42,022
initiation. Fuck me dead.

173
00:10:42,086 --> 00:10:45,734
Not a good choice of words where a prospective

174
00:10:45,782 --> 00:10:49,226
gang member was required to kill a random person. Or maybe it was

175
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:52,720
just a thrill kill. He had a wife and kids.

176
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,040
The murder case remains unsolved to this day.

177
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,774
Well, as always, that has been a very

178
00:11:01,892 --> 00:11:04,846
fun edition of Confess your sins this week.

179
00:11:04,948 --> 00:11:08,530
Hey, we just had a thought. We've only been collecting the ones

180
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,874
of people who drive the taxis. And weren't they

181
00:11:11,912 --> 00:11:16,038
just a topsy turvy adventure. Of all the emotions that one could possibly experience.

182
00:11:16,204 --> 00:11:20,230
I'm guessing that you backseat drivers have some stories.

183
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,960
Maybe we can find out who did that. Hey,

184
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,686
probably not, though. But wouldn't it be a video? We'll see you

185
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:30,662
next, Jesus. Look, man, I'm very glad that you did that,

186
00:11:30,716 --> 00:11:34,466
but ain't going to eat, too. Just clearly

187
00:11:34,498 --> 00:11:37,800
not as bad as you did in 1996. All right, I'll see you next time.

188
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,600
He's gone. So go see his Adelaide show.

189
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:46,494
Yeah, that place that I want the guy at the end

190
00:11:46,532 --> 00:11:48,140
of this story to come see it.
