Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to your favorite series on the Internet, guess the elo. And if this is your first time watching, well, I don't really know what you've been waiting for. This is a series where I analyze my subscriber games from start to finish blindly, and then I predict their chess strength and compare it to that of chess.com. This is our first episode in a while, but this is a big episode because I am pretty sure this is episode number 69, which is the universally accepted nice number. Without further ado, we are going to witness spectacular blunders, brilliant sacrifices and checkmating attacks, spectacular guesses and disastrous guesses, and we are going to have a great time. Here we go. All right. E four. And we're off. E five. Knight f three. Knight c six. Okay. Symmetrical italian game. Castles is not the most accurate move. C three. Threatening the move. D four is an accurate move, but castles is fine. Okay. A three. Okay. Casual. What? Casual. Chess today at. Yo, why are you advertising a local address? Dude, what? What are you doing? A five. Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness. A three. Trying to go. B four. Black plays a five. That's wild stuff. C three. Okay, yeah. Can we just play this move here? Can we just do this? This. Come on, y'all. Wait, what? Not even d four, rookie. One. Bro. He's not even playing. D four. What is this? Opening. You got to go d four. Now, there's something called a center fork trick. 94, rookie. Four. D five. Which is when you take in the center and then something takes back and then pawn to d five, but. Okay. All right. D four. There it is. Yes. Now, white immediately goes wrong. This is a bad move, because even though it attacks the knight, the knight just rotates. The bishop is now blocked. And you've reopened Black's bishop in a closed center position like this. You're always looking at f five. This move should be played at some point, because what it does is it opens up a lot of lines over here. You don't even have to acknowledge that. Okay, take queen d two. Knight g six. Nice. F 595. Now put the knight in the center. Oh, I like that. Bishop h three. Oh, Bishop h three. Oh, gothams. Got thems. Got them, got them, got them. Oh, it's checkmate. Wow, this is my last time subbing because I realized you're a narcissist. Shout out, narcissist af. Queen takes g three is game over. Queen take this hero bishop. Pinning the pawn to the king. Oh, my goodness. Now I'm expecting pawn takes, which by the way, is not even a bad move. You hang your queen, but you take with check, and then you make a new one. So it's not even. Okay. Black plays queen g four. Black misses both of those. Black plays one square and queen g three again. No. Why would you leave? Okay, take on g three, fg. Okay, this is a very rare exception. Where f takes g six is the best move because you open up the rook. Ooh, it's a reach on zug. But now Bishop takes h seven is also in between move, and it's a desperado. Okay, now we have a. Now the queen comes back. Oh, that's a good move. Oh, my God. The hero king. Oh, the knight. Oh. Knight f four. Vicious. Queen b two. Check. That's the best move. That's the top computer move. The king is running. What is the. He hung the rook. He hung the rook. But queen g three is. Queen g three is winning. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Queen g three took the rook. But it's not made. He's covered. He's covered. He's covered. Nah, he hung mate again, bro. Oh, my God. Rook h three. Oh, my God. Yo, he took the pawn at the wrong moment. Rook h three now has just made it. Now white is winning again. Rook h three. Oh, my goodness. Rook h one. And rook h two wins the queen. Holy smokes. Black is winning. If you have the endgame's masterclass, you would know why Black is winning. This would be in the Endgame imbalances chapter or the rooks chapter. Black is winning here because of the pawns and the fact that white is extremely passive here on the back rank. Let's see if black is able to win this. I would not rush with the exchanges, but, yeah, you have the pawn. Yeah. Now. Yeah, there you go. Get the pawns in there. Get the pawns in there. Nice and easy. Easy game. Beautiful. It was made in one, like, two different ways here, but all right, we took the rook and we get the Dubsky. Okay, so were those. Yo, stop selling out my brother. You're going to get permanently banned and clowned on in a guest. The Elo episode. I'd like you to write one final message to the stream and one final message to the beautiful YouTube audience. What do you want your last message to be before we hit Perma ban YouTube? Let it happen. YouTube. I know this is rough. This is like watching a kid get yelled at by their parent at the playground. You want to step in and. No, we parent the way we parent here. He said loser he went out with a bang. Nice. We are going to ban this young fellow, but we're not going to ban him because we are offended. We're going to ban him because it's summer and rather than spending time behind a screen, go outside. School's out. We're all losers. You know what I'm saying? We're all losers. We all got to go outside at some point. I feel like you are italian more than american. All right, we're going to perma ban that guy. No, I'm just kidding. What? All right, let's guess the Elo. It was a decent opening. I mean, sometimes people who are like, twelve, 1300, play, like, obscure opening lines. It was, admittedly a very interesting game. A very back and forth game. How much do we deduct for missing this checkmate, like, seven times? I mean. I mean, this is definitely a four digit game, right? Definitely a four digit game. There was some sophisticated stuff here, but, man, Queen takes g three. I mean, I'm going to say 1100. I just don't feel like there was enough control of the game to be any higher than that. I'm going to say eleven, 1200. Like, high 1100, maybe 1180. 1170. Because I just feel like there was a complete lack of control. This is not who played this game. 1100, 1160. Okay, black is 1260. But that's what I said. I said high 1100. I said high. 1111. 60. Okay, black was 1260. I guess black. But Black won the game. So I guess black was a little bit higher than my estimate, but, yeah, I probably looked beforehand. You got me. Surprise. Guys, I've been cheating at Gez the Elo for over 60 episodes, and you've been falling for it. That's why frequently, I'm off by 500 points. No, that guy got me. Oh, my goodness. He got me. Oh, my goodness. Surprise. Surprise, guys. I've been lying to you the whole time. Oh, my goodness. Goodness gracious. How did I get discovered? That's crazy stuff. All right, let's go back here. Oh, I just realized we recorded the first game on a slightly different overlay. Yeah, I'll check the chess.com estimation on the next one. I'm a little bit worried about crashing my computer right now. It's been getting all funky with me recently. All right. E Scandinavian. I feel levy can be gm in seven years if he tries. That's fine. We're all entitled to opinions, even if they're bad. Okay, so this is like the Scandinavian declined. But the problem with putting your pawn here is that black has not yet played a french defense, you understand, like E French. That's an advanced French. The problem with doing it this way is black is going to play bishop f five and c five. So you gave black a really, really good French and a really good Caro, so you shouldn't play e five on the second move against the scandinavian. No way. Okay, never mind. Well, black just voluntarily went back to a French, so. Yeah, that's. Yeah, cool stuff. That's good. Let's see. D four. C five. C four. Bishop g five. Okay. Already things are quite weird. Yeah, things are already very, very strange here. Okay, night. A seven. Wow. Sensational. B five. B three. All right, we're a little thing over here on this side of the board. F six. Very, very mysterious. Pawn pushing going on. G four. Okay, this is a triple digit game for sure. Very uga. Okay, we took Bishop h five. Check. No. Bishop h five. Check. Oh, bishop h five. Check. Now you can't even. Oh, we found the fork he took the bishop with. Check. Which actually might have even been the best move. He went back for the rook. Yeah, typical 25 move. Castles. All right. Incredible. Should be three. I can't really. Oh. Pawn to b two. Oh. How do you even. What is even the best move now? This just looks hopeless. Rook takes e six. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. That's the best move because king takes Bishop f four. Discover. Check. What? What? And now white has this. And if you take. Oh, that's what happened. Rookie eight. Oh, my God. Rookie eight. No. Take the queen. He can't take back because queen fade is big. Queen fade is mate. Yo, this dude playing white played an absolutely terrible game. I am not capping. This was not good by anybody. Black played worse, probably. This was a very, very back and forth affair. Okay, are these two moves cheating? Are they brilliant? And this whole time, white was high rated? Or are they an accidental brilliant combo? What happened? What happened? How did homie sack the rook and the knight? Double brilliant. How did that happen? Cheating accident actually was 2400 and just played the whole game deliberately poorly. What is going on here? I mean, now I got to look at this game and consider both these players as just 2000s, mindlessly shuffling their pieces back. I mean, g four. H four is crazy. Okay? Nobody rated over 1200 should be playing g four in this position. It's just an insane move. The Bishop H five is just winning. I mean, like, bishop H five, even here is winning all this. Focus on the. Yeah, jeez. Like any high rated player. Here goes. Bishop H five. Which makes me think between eight and 900. That's what I'm thinking. Unless these people deliberately threw this game. I just can't. No high rated player plays c four here. No high rated player plays c four. It's just not a good move. I think it's like around 900. That's what I'm going to say. What do we think? 1300? Oh, my God. A 1300. Played c four. And white has gm in his username. White, wouldn't it? Oh, no. Oh, I did not know y'all. Y'all know. I think they know each other. I think they know each other. I think they were on a phone call or something. No. What does chess.com think? Right? Chess.com thought white was a 1300 and it thought black was a 1050. Man, shut up. Chess.com shut up. You don't know anything stupid. Chess.com stupid. I don't even. That's crazy. Desperate times call for desperate measures. And I guess black delivered. Oh, my goodness. Damn. We can send our games. You could send anything you want. I mean, I'm not going to look at your games, but you could. Go ahead. Gotham sub playing with the black pieces in game number three. Um. Okay. D. White is worse on move two and three in the caro. Nice. Ooh. Okay. 500, right? Got to be queen h four. Game over. Just literally game over on the spot. You win by force. Black to play. Win by force. Queen h four. King e two. Bishop G four. Pins the king to the queen. Knight f three. You actually can just take it. King comes forward, queen slides back, x ray. King to queen. And that's game over. So here and there is a major difference between this position and this position. If you try to do the same thing in this position, White has this. Did you see what happened on Anna cramling tournament? Some bug turn stream during game. Oh, what is that? Some bug turn stream during game. What? So the pawn on c six covers this. Check. Very small detail, but very, very underappreciated detail. A bug crawled on the camera. Oh, I would have been if it's. If it was a bag. Unmuted the commentary. That's crazy. Wow. That's one of the reasons. Why did I just switch to the other game? That's one of the reasons I cannot do comment like, I cannot. I would just be embarrassed. I just would be so embarrassed. Anyway. Queen H four. Check. Was winning, but okay. C five. Knight C six. What? Good. Queen H four. Nice. All right. Black is going to win this game. This is going to be one of those games that a user submits where? Yeah. They just completely destroy their opponent. Okay. Oh, my God. I think queen B five might be a draw very soon. Oh, my goodness. What is this position? Whoa. Oh. What is the only reason that this is not immediately winning for White is because 97 is check. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Not only is 97 check, after that, you can castle in its mate. Oh. Seeing. Oh, 97. And the legendary tactic. Wow. There it is. Out in the wild. This only comes around like once every decade. But there it is. Short castles and its mate on the back rank white, absolutely devoured. Here by the towers. The rooks just look on peacefully or it'll run away. Oh, that's absolutely sensational. Imagine booting up a chess game, pushing all of your pawns out, then moving your queen and bishop out like that, losing all of your pieces. And your king gets like a three mile run in before getting checkmated on the opposite rank. I don't. How does. Okay, this is like a 5600 game, right? I mean, I-I-I don't. I think if white is any higher than 600, I don't know. I'm going to have a really big problem with that. It's got to be like 5600. What? White is 900. Nope. And what does chess.com think? 300. This it? No. Yeah, no. Wow. That was bad. Yeah. When I start thinking that the players know each other and they colluded to make a game, that's bad. That's very bad. I'm the only non Vtube streamer in your. In your. Well, if you want, I can act like a vtuber. I can do this whole next game with this voice. E four. C five. E three. No, it's okay. I'll do my normal voice. I could if you want, but I feel like. I feel like people are going to unlock something in themselves that they were not comfortable unlocking. All right. A three Sicilian with the intention of playing b four. B four. What? Yeah. See, this is why you all got to not buy courses if you're not just the fact that White played d three. Thank you. Board detector. There you go. Board detector just unlocked something inside themselves. So they gifted ten subs. Yeah. So, like, look, I feel as though somebody probably bought the e four course and then just, like, didn't actually study it whatsoever. So. Yeah. Okay, now we're just playing a normal game of chess. But the pawn is on a three. No problem. Okay. Oh, zipping around over there. Oh, wow. Oh, my goodness. White went bishop g five, then decided, I'm going to go Bishop h six and then decided I'm going to go bishop g five and then lost the bishop. Okay, that's just. Okay, now, right? Creepy crawly 94 is a nice move here. H four, aggressive. H five, aggressive. Hg. Okay, don't take this because then you're going to open up the center. Okay, very nice. Slide the king over. Pun g three. Got to go for it. Rook h three. Okay, the knight was just trapped with a six because it actually couldn't go anywhere. Oh, look at this. This is big boy stuff. I'm not trying to call you fat. I don't know how much you weigh. I'm just saying, this is like, oh, look at that. Confident. March forward. Oh. Rook h seven is 100% going to get blundered. It's 100% going to get blundered. Now, queen g six is mate and attacking on f. It's still mate, by the way. It's still mate. If you sack the queen, you might have some sort of checkmate or rook h seven or where's he going to play queen f six? Take the knight. Take the knight. Violent king hunt. Oh, no. Oh, no. You let the king escape. Oh, my God. No, you lost all your pieces. No, you're going to lose your queen. Oh, my goodness. He did lose the rook. He did lose the rook. What is going on? He lost on time. I think he lost on time. Oh, no, it was just mate. It's just checkmate. All he's got to do is take the night with either piece. Queen f six is made and won like nine different ways afterward. Oh, my God. Wow. White actually did a lot of stuff right in that game and then just lost immediately. I mean, like, white did not play well. White is obviously still very much a beginner. But listen, there were signs of logic. Like h four, h five is very clever. This was very smart. Just this kind of game planning alone. But then, like, kind of a lack of detail makes me think like 700. No, I think for white to play like very. Okay, obviously you're going to make blunders, but then to come up with this h pawn attack and then all of this to play pawn to g three, get the bishop out of the way, play f four and e five. Big brain stuff. This was all very logically planned out. I'm going to say high 700, I think, because I just don't understand in what universe an 1100 would blunder this. And then there was just a lot of, like, very one move style chess. And then, I mean, missing maiden one is crazy. There's no way it's 900. Yeah, I mean, if they're the same levels, then maybe like, maybe like 900. But I think black overperformed for sure. But I want to say around 800. But let's see. Oh, my God. White is 530, and black is 985. Damn, bro. Okay, well, you outperform, bro. I mean, listen, you outperformed. I said you were like, 7800. You play you 500, you got promise. You got promise. But four weeks later, I studied a three Sicilian, and I got plus two on move nine against the 1700. Well, look at that. I mean, look at, look at that. Look at that. Look at the Gotham opening repertoire getting you a winning position against the 1700. Oh, my goodness. 500. Elo. Getting a nice little. Nice little cook going on the board. Damn. I like that. That was a good game. That was a nicely played chess game. I have to give credit where it's due. We have one more game today. Chess.com estimate. The chess.com estimate was. I'm looking now. Bring us back there. The chess.com estimate was that white was 750, which is what I said. And black was seven. That's crazy. I said 7800. Yep. Yes. Read it and weep. All right, we have got a final game here. This was a nice and quick game. Now, I saw the first three moves of the opening. This is what they are. So we're already off to a really good start. Blocking in the knight, blocking in the bishop. The triangle attack. It's like a London, but much worse, because you don't actually develop a bishop. You block both of your pieces. You also weaken your king, which is something you don't do in the London. It's like the London, but worse in every single sense. Black is playing. Fantastic. Now, Black should Castle play d five. Those should be the next two moves. Your opponent allows you to put two pawns in the center. That's what you should do, because the trade benefits black here and Castle. Here's what I think. I think this is a bullet game. Hear me out. I think I'm Sherlock Holmes. I think black was playing normally, but saw that white was pre moving every move. I think this is what white does. White pre moved all of these moves. White pre moved c three to go here, so that you prevent knight d four. And then black at this point was like, wait a minute. White is pre moving every move. So I'm going to take the knight because they're not going to pre move this is that crazy. You see? Okay, never mind. Maybe these are just like 400. H five. Wow. H five. Okay, now, here come the queen before check. Now, why would you go there? Why would you go there? Why would you not put the knight in the center and then go queen before check and just take everything? Now what is this? Take the pawn. Good move. You can't take the knight now. Okay, nice little combo here. 94. Check. Can't take the queen because it's check. 94. Take the queen fork. Play this first tempo winning move. Then you attract the king to e three, and then you play fork. But okay, this is fine. Knight f six. C five. Knight G four. That's it. That, that was the game. Okay. Pretty gangster, you know? Okay. I mean, you killed him. I guess we're ending today's episode with just, with just a murder. Like, I feel like, feel like cops gonna get called on my, on my house now, but, you know, it is what it is. Um, I have absolutely no idea. How much info do I have from moves like Knight H seven and D five? I think this is a bullet game played between 213 hundreds. Can I say, I'm going to guess the time control. Okay. This is either 1300 bullet. If it's anything above bullet. If this is like a rapid game, then I'm going to say, like, I don't know, 600, 700. Twitch is getting advertisements now. That's very funny. We're going to reveal it. And they're not even going to get to see the big reveal, but you will on YouTube. All right, I'm guessing. Those are my guesses. Let's see. 300. Blitz game. I thought it was a 1300. Yo, y'all are 300. Y'all are good for 300, bro. That's crazy. I thought you guys were 1300. Oh, my goodness. What does chess.com think you? Is chess.com going to guess, like, based on your ratings, is chess.com going to be like, or what is it going to say? Oh, I thought black is 700. What a beast. And how much time was spent on. No, there wasn't even pre moving. Nah, that's crazy. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. He spent 5 seconds on that move.
