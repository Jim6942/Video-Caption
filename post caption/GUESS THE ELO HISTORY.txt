Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to your favorite series on the Internet, guess the Elo. If you're a new viewer, then welcome. It's so nice to have you. And if you're a returning viewer and you've been watching for a long time, my condolences. I am actually very, very sorry in this series. Friendly reminder, five games submitted to me while I'm live on Twitch by my subscribers. I analyze the game from start to finish, and then I try to guess what the elo of the players is and also what chess.com thinks it is, because now chess.com has a ratings estimating feature. Now, today's episode is historic. Why is it historic? Because I needed a new title. Because I'm like, 70 titles into this series. But also the last game of today's episode. My subscriber claimed this has never happened in a guest the Elo before. Frankly, I don't remember. So it's up to you. Guess the elo detectives find if the conclusion of the last game of the last episode today has ever happened before in guest the Elo or not. Enjoy. E four. C. Hi to YouTube now, pawn takes. Knight takes Tartakawer. Bishop D three. Actually, Bishop d three is a gambit, but I think white just lost the pawn. I think white just forgot that pawn is not guarded. What? All right. I don't know what the heck knight g four is all about. I never taught you all to play. No. Night. G four. What does this even do? Like, is there a. Okay, that's not a problem. Oh, okay. Night. Wow. I would do this now and fork these two pieces. Beautiful. Trade the queens. Trade the knight for the bishop. Develop all your pieces. Okay. Don't like that move, but also don't hate it. All right, now you got to take. You got no choice. Oh, my goodness. Oh, my God. Why? Okay, why is this a bad move? Fundamentally, what is wrong with the move e five? It doesn't quite lose a pawn. Right now, there's nothing technically wrong with it, but in the long run, for your chess development, this is a terrible move. You are opening up the center with your king still there. And unless black gets the castling right away, black is going to get obliterated. All right. It's a bad habit to create. Yeah. Now you got. Oh, my God. Now you take. And you don't even take the right piece. Please, Castle. Yet. See, now, like, I knew it. Now there's all sorts of problems. You got all sorts of problems. Oh, my God. And you lose immediately. Why is this losing? Bishop takes night. Bishop takes knight. Why? You take with the knight, you lose your rook. If you take with the king, you get right into the way of this. Exactly what I said. I knew when the movie five happened. This is why it's guess the Elo is good when it's funny, but guess the Elo is also good because it's instructional. Because look at black is just completely negating. Black is reacting move by move to everything. Oh, Bishop. Okay, me attack. And white does this. And even though that's not the best move, it's still very good. Because if this. And if this d six is hanging, and if this, then rook d six. No, not only not rook d six, you also hang your own bishop. Why is it so bad, by the way? Is it just because you take the bishop and you're just better? No, you don't even take the bishop. You go rook d eight. Okay, that was a complete accident. I would like you all to know right now, hand to God, that black had no idea. That was the top engine move. All right? Black had absolutely no idea. Okay, knight f two. Now black castles, like twelve moves too late. F five. Okay, fine. Okay. I'm terrified. I have no idea. Great move. And now it's going to be rook d two, and it's going to be bishop f four. All right, I can predict the future with low Elo chess. Low Elo players react to things in one move. Rookie two is a fantastic move. And I know for a fact white is going to go here trying to trade this. There it is. And now bishop f four. Beautiful stuff. Takes. Okay, that's a bad move. You should double up the rooks on the second rank. But this is not bad. Don't disconnect your, oh, gorgeous technique. Yep. Okay. The fact that black played king to g seven in this position and did not see rook takes pawn. Got to be like 700. Okay, six to 700, if even. All right, I'm saying mid six hundred s. I feel like if you played now, they took. But, like, what on earth is king g seven? And now the moves went back to normal. Oh, my gosh. The opening was real weird. The opening was real weird. No, black just won. There is no stalemate. Black just won. Of course, white should not resign here. Yeah, I'm going to say, like 700. 700, I think 700. The opening. I mean, they knew the target. Nike four is a crazy move and just a lot, a lot of bad decision making here. I would say, like 700. Hopefully high 700. 750. You guys feeling generous? Watch should be like a thousand. I mean, like, honestly, for all these memes. Watch it be a thousand. It's not Gotham chess, by the way. Wow. It's 900 versus 1014. That's tough. Good lord. Really? It was a 30 minutes game, too, or. Yeah. All right. I did not like this was a very scatterbrained game. Nike four is a weird move that this is an overthinking of the position. I guess you kind of have to know what you're doing. I guess black was trying to. And knight h three is insane for a 900 to play night h three. Like, you guys have to understand when I do. Guest elo. I'm guessing it off of certain things. I'm guessing it off the fact that white played night h three. Night h three is not a good move. It's just not. All right. And then this was all right. But not taking on d seven was a little bit wild. And then not taking the bishop was a little bit wild. All right. Not the worst thing in the world, but a little mellow start here. A little mellow start. All right. Please pick my game. Okay, no worries. I will totally pick your game. After going through every single game that has already been chosen and then completely ignoring your message. Night f three. Why is Gotham so mean to the viewers? Sorry, I was preparing myself for the comments. Night f three already? Wow. 25. Okay. I was going to say that white is, like, really high rated. And then black went here. There is nothing terribly wrong with the move d four. It's just the fact that when you just march a lone pawn into your opponent's position, they can just trade it. That's just the thing. And, I mean, you could try to hang on to it, but you're probably going to lose it. And if this, you have things like knight d four, and you've already lost the pawn, and if queen d four, you lose much more than a pawn. All right. Anyway. D three. All right. Oh, God. Now, you definitely don't umpass on here. I know. Okay. Black does it. Of course. Queen d three. Now. Yep. Punishing immediately. Yeah, you don't really want to give away the bishop for the night, but whatever. Queen d, sound the alarm. Oh, on the board. On the board. On the board. On the board. Take the knight. Oh, gorgeous. Yup. No. Okay, how many points do we deduct from the estimate? For what? Okay. Any intermediate player gets the other rook into the game here. Right. My one five hundreds in the chat. My one five hundreds on YouTube. You got to go rook fd one. Right? I mean, the person going here has got to be like, 100. Because you're already out. You haven't moved that rook yet, right? I mean, that's a big piece of info. 95 is good, though. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. And now Bishop C three. And then you could take the knight, but for black to find that, I mean, that's craziness. Oh, this is tough. Rook c one. Wait, they are playing really well. Okay, how did you just do all of that? And now you won't even come home. The knight is dancing around. And now the first move, it has to escape. You move the rook. Why? Oh, my God. You're just not escaping. Okay, thank you. Now you're escaping. Oh, my God. You hung your bishop. Wait, I'm sorry. What on earth, man? Oh, it's a draw. Oh, you're winning. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I thought it was perpetual. Oh, my God. I thought it was perpetual. Oh, God. That was very tricky. You couldn't take because you were going to lose the rook. Wow. And you lost your rook. And you lost your rook anyway. And I feel like someone's going to lose, but I don't know who. Okay, black stopped the promotion. Yes, of course. Instead of moving the apon down the board, we move our king because. I don't know, reasons. A four. Thank you. A three. What the. Why? For what reason are we going? What? Are you worried about this? Okay, there is no chance in a million years you even saw that this was a fork or you thought that this was just winning. Okay. That you didn't see that. All right? This is luck. It's all luck. God. And the worst part is, the bishop cuts everything. Now just king b, three, and push the pawn. I mean, the bloodlust, to give a second, to give a check for absolutely no reason. And now the only thing you can do is go here. And of course, you don't. And of course, you don't. And of course, you don't. And now it's over. Now it's a draw. Oh, my God, there was Bishop H six. Oh, my God, there was Bishop H six. Oh, my God, it was over. Oh, I don't know. 1051. 100, Max. 1100. Max. Absolute Max. It's like a thousand. There's no way. This game was too chaotic. Thousand. I was right. Oh, my God. 980 versus a thousand. Oh, my God. Read it and weep. I am a legend. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I knew it. On the money. On the money. In the money. Give me the money. No, but seriously, hit subscribe and subscribe for free with prime. And if you're watching on YouTube. I don't know. Check out one of my chestley free sample courses. That doesn't give me any money, but it'll give you tremendous personal satisfaction. Oh, wow. That was amazing stuff. Wow. Sobbing and shaking right now, dude. So am I. Oh, goodness, goodness, goodness, goodness, goodness. My goodness. My gracious, my goodness. Oh, my God. That was amazing. Great game. I learned a lot. Game three. All right. I selected this game myself because I saw the preview of this game. I saw the first five moves of this game in the discord before I chose this game. You guys are about to laugh a lot. Are you ready? Vienna Gambit. Right? By the way, free sample of the e four course. 100% free sample. You don't have to spend any money. It's on Chesley. Under e four course. This is covered. Okay. And this is covered, which is something that a lot of people play at intermediate level. White goes here. Okay? Now, in the vienna, black can either do this or this or they lose their knight. Okay, sounds good. Black cannot go forward. So in this game, black goes forward. That's game over, right? That's game over. White goes here, losing the game to queen h four. Check. By the way, as a side note, I mean, folks, I literally. Okay, you know that saying, you can bring a horse to water, but you can't get it to drink? All right, not only are you not a horse, and instead you are mules. I literally threw you in a lake, and you still died of thirst. You were in a lake of water. Okay? You could have drank water by accident, and you still won't drink. Okay? It's not a matter of bringing you to the water. I am throwing you into a lake, and you still refuse to drink the water. Knight to e four is Yazia. Okay. Yazya pyga, as they say. All right. Oh, my God. Knight c five. Oh, love it. Knight f three. Okay, do you know how white played the move? Bishop f four. This is a massive problem that you guys have. You go like this. This is the way you guys play chess, okay? This is what you do. You play chess like this. You go, oh, I'm going to take pawn, and you do this, right? And you're like, oh, wait, I can't do that. And while this is still open, okay, while this is still on, you go, oh, if I go there, I get taken. So I'm going to go there. What? Just because you highlighted a piece doesn't mean you got to move it. What is it? What even is bishop d two? Why? First of all, get the knights out first. All right, just in general, good rule of thumb. Get the knights out first. Knight f three. Second of all. Go. D five. You don't got to play bishop. D two. Yeah. Now you just. Okay. Oh, my bro. Bro. It. Oh, get him. Oh, get him. Oh. Okay. Get his ass. Get his ass. That's it. That's the whole game nbulance impression. You like that? Wow. 300. 300. I mean, listen, we've all been there. Not me, but you guys. 300. Got to be right. That's crazy. That's crazy. No. 633 570. No, guys. No, this is not good. No, I don't even. Come on, dudes. You guys got to get better at tactics. Oh, goodness. What does chess.com think? Oh, God, I'm terrified. What does chess.com think? Honestly, do we have to look? I'm going to look. Chess.com thought that white was 350, by the way. I said that. All right, can I give myself some credit? Chess.com says white is 350. Chesscom thinks black is 100. The only thing below 100 is Danny Wrench's face. So I'm going to take a little credit, because I said 300. It straight up thinks black, like, just made an account and lost 20 games in a row. That's tough. All right. Gotham sub in game five of today's episode is playing with black. And okay. Is playing a caro, even though it's not an e four opening. Always love that. Good. Oh. E five. Oh, sensational. Wow. Oh, great heavens. Oh, that's a terrible move. I want to see e four lock the door. That's not how you should play chess, okay. Of course the bishop should go here. Okay. If you're going to develop the bishop anywhere, that's what you should do. You should also lock the center. Why? Because the person that wants to attack. You might not even know you want to attack, but you should attack. The person who wants to attack wants a close center. Okay? That's what they want to do. So h six is a very good move. H five and so on. It's all reasonable stuff. Yeah. Okay. Bishop before just doesn't cut it, and neither does that. But now your opponent, because they absent mindedly chased your bishop, got you into a good position. F four. Okay. Just judging from the complete inability for either side to capture a central pawn, I'm saying, like, 700. Okay? Because noobs. Noobs, you all have this problem. You just forget you can take central pawns. I don't know why. You just put them out there, and then you just forget they can take each other. This is actually insane. What the hell is going on? Okay, well, you did that to yourself. Oh, my God. Long castle. Oh, my God. F five. What the hell? What? Nah, this is a fake game. Bishop. Bro, if I find out this is a fake game, I'm going to be so mad. It's just mate. Queen A, six. Queen B, seven. Just queen a six, queen B, seven. What? I don't understand. I'm getting mad. I didn't get mad at the other people. The other people were noobs. I feel like y'all are just deliberately not playing the best moves. And now. What is this, guys, what? What is this? Queen A. Come on, man. Is this a real game? I mean, that. Guys, I'm sorry, but, I mean, can you imagine? You, like, played a bad game of chess, and the streamer thinks it's fake. Like, that's how bad the game was. I mean, this is a bad game. It's not even bad that you were making bad moves. Okay? Last game that I just looked at, they were making bad moves, but they were noobs, all right? They were kind of following up to logically, guys, it literally feels like you were playing russian roulette and every piece got a turn. No move made sense together. Like, you sack to open the queen, and then you go here. That's crazy. Oh, God. Yeah, but the opening was fine. I mean, my God, I don't know. 500? 500. I mean, if it's going to be like 218 hundreds, obviously fake game, right? So I'm going to say 500. Maybe they're actually 500. It happens. We've all been 500. I mean, I haven't, but I just want to make you feel bad. 500. 400. And black's rating is 500 on the dot. 500 literally on the dot. Yeah, it really kind of feels like they played this game and a dice was rolled every time somebody had to make a move. Literally. I mean, good lord, folks. Okay, and what does chess.com think you are? I'm terrified of this. Chess.com thinks you are. 250 and 350. Yeah, that's. Guys, what happened here? Can I just. Like, what you all played a normal af opening. Like, what was this? I mean, this was crazy normal then. Okay. Nah, you know what? But, like, this was fine. And then y'all just stopped making any logical moves. Maybe that's what. Oh, my God. And black got a brilliant. Oh, my God. Black got a brilliant. Tremendous. That was an insane game, y'all. That was an insane game. And you know the way you're supposed to learn in chess by the way I would recommend learning in chess, and you should listen to me, because I understand the mind of a chess beginner, is you got to find a way to take something more generally out of this game. So, more generally, you both have massive. First of all, stop pushing pawns where you castle completely. Stop doing that right now. All right? Second of all, you cannot just have a massive blind spot for the center. You got to clarify the center. Take something, push something. All right? After that, more general stuff is look at the most valuable captures, because if you saw Pontex h three, you obviously saw that. And. Yeah, I mean, beyond that. I don't know beyond that. Honestly, beyond that, just play chess and have fun. There is very little general knowledge beyond that. I mean, honestly, this game was chaos. If I could give you any advice, it would be minimize chaos in your games. Literally. I don't know how I'm supposed to do that, but you both are just completely playing past each other. All right? This individual submitted a game and claimed that this would be guess the elo history. Okay? This person claimed that the game that they submitted with black had a finish. That has never happened before in guess the elo history. All right? We have an albin counter gambit, and they said that we could permanently ban them after they gave ten subs. So, basically, this person said, if this is not a historic moment, they will give ten subs, and then we will permanently ban them. They did not say the permanently banned part, okay? They just said the ten subs, okay. Immediately worse, because you just play e four. Very good. Now, there is a very, very neat trap here, okay? There's a very famous story that I have a clip on somewhere on YouTube, and it's a story of this trick where you can play e three fe, queen h four. Check. And especially in speed games, what is black's pre move? In this position, anytime your opponent is checked and can only block it with a pawn like this, you pre move bishop e seven. Why do you. In fact, you don't even pre move it. What you do is you hover on the bishop like this, and you don't pre move it. You hesitate for, like, half a second, and then you do this, and your opponent's like, oh, what an idiot, and then you win. Now, if they don't take your queen, you're just worse. But you're not, like, losing, but you're worse. Well, in this case, I guess you are losing, but, like, whatever. You literally are trying to sack a queen for no reason. So knight c three c six. Great stuff. I love this. Yeah, beautiful. I would play a six, prevent anything from going to b five. Wow. White. Okay, you messed up. H five is a gigantic, gigantic piece of information. All right? H five is like showing your opponent in poker one of your cards. What do you do here? You play a waiting move. Let them castle. Let them castle. Okay. Castle. Then you play h five, because your opponent is never going to see Bishop h two coming. And if they play h three, what do you play? G five or bishop c seven, queen d six or bishop f five, queen d seven, and sack the bishop. All right, so by going h five, your opponent's like, oh, well, I'm just never going to castle. You understand? Yeah. And you see now your bishop is kind of cooked. Yup. Yup. All right. Oh, Levi, I bought your carl concourse. Okay, first of all, my name is not Levi. Second of all, you called it a can course. No, caro. Third of all, you said some drills have less moves than the studies. That is a feature. That is not a drawback. All right? There is no reason for you to memorize 30 moves of theory unless you are, like, 2300. So you need to be able to memorize, and at the same time, you need to be able to explain the concepts. It's a little bit less important than doing, like, a 20 move drill. We did that on purpose. I promise. All right? Now, if you think there is a place that is drastically, drastically under drilled, submit it to the support. We have a fantastic support team. We have course editors. All right, that was not a roast, but he did call me Levi, which is very disrespectful. All right, rookie eight. So, again, since your opponent is going to Castle, you should probably move this rook there. Right? Sorry for wrong name. No problem. You were 75% correct. Okay. Free pawn. Okay. May I ask a question? Why would you point a bazooka at a wall, okay. And then park your own car in front of it? Like you're going to shoot a bazooka at a wall. You want to shoot it at your own car instead. You don't know what I mean by that. I don't know what I mean by that? All right. Nobody knows what I mean. Nobody knows. I just say things. Okay. Do it again. Yeah. F 595. Okay. I love this. Yeah. See, remember how in the last game, the noobs have a blind spot in the center of the board and its pawns? Do I not have mods? No, I do. Let me show you. Hold on. So, yeah. Intermediate players have a blind spot for center pieces. If you're playing white here, you should take. Why? Because it enables this move. It enables that move. And if knight C five, there's queen c two and all this stuff. Right? You don't want to just go here and lose a knight. But intermediate players just, like, shove pieces into the center, and then those pieces get taken, and then they take a rook and hang a queen. All right, well, this is bad. So you said this has never happened in guess the elo history. And what might that be? Oh, okay. That's actually interesting. Okay. I feel like I'm looking at a double rainbow. A little smothered mate action. Smothered mate action. Well, someone's going to have to find it because there's 70 episodes, by the way, black played really well. Can I just give some props like black played? Okay. H five was a gross overstepping. Let your opponent castle. All right. Before you play h five, white played fine, but, yeah, then it got really uga, like here. Black just black just doing whatever they want. But black played well. White did not play well. But it's very tough to say. Tough to say because white did not have much all game. I'm going to say, like 50. Like 15 1600. I'm going to say 15 1600. And white did not have a good weapon against the albin. Let's see this game. 1556 versus 1599. And I said 15 1600. It's because he's the goat. What's included in the e four course? I have no idea. But you know who does? The website and the table of contents, which is publicly listed on the website. Good night. Bye.
