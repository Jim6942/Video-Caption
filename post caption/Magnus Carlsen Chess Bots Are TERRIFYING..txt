It. Ladies and gentlemen, happy new year. Hope you all have a wonderful 2024. And we are going to kick off 2024 with a bang, as today, chess.com has announced new bots, and they are none other than bots of Magnus Carlson. And I am going to play against them. And I have been told there is a secret bot as well. So I will try to discover what on earth they are talking about. They have not given me much information, but that is what I have to work with. Friendly reminder, today is January 1. Today is the last day you can get any of my courses for 40% off. The holidays are over. So if your loved ones didn't get you a holiday present, you could set a new year's resolution. Go study some end games. Go study some tactics, some middle games. Learn that opening you've always wanted to learn. I'm going to play against the Magnus bots, and we're going to have a blast. I mean, chess.com, I was really worried because 2023 just ended. Magnus won every tournament, but he's not playing for the world championship. He's not playing in the candidates. What are we going to do with no Magnus? Well, obviously we're going to farm Magnus for content, even like this. Okay, so our bots are, we have sleeping Magnus, and then we have a couple of others. There's sleeping Magnus, ski magnus, soccer Magnus, chef Magnus, and Magnus, just Magnus. I'm kind of sad they don't have drunk Magnus because that's definitely one of the most powerful chess players in the world. Maybe they'll change it up. I'm going to play maybe one or two games against each one. Then we're going to play Magnus. We're going to try to see what on earth chess.com is talking about with their bots. Let's open up with e four. Let's see what dialogue he has. Oh, does he have no dialogue? Is the point that he's asleep? Okay. He played the sicilian defense. I'm going to play the Alipin. Trying to put two pawns in the center. He went d five. I think I have animations off, by the way. So let me fix that. I usually have it on this setting. Play d five. It's a normal move. He's Asleep. So he's not talking. That just said Z's. All right. Tremendous. All right. That's not an accurate move in general. Just move in general. You should not be making queen moves in the opening too many times. Okay. Obviously, Magnus is not. He's not awake yet. Okay. He's trying to mate me over here. I don't need to acknowledge this. In general, striking against the flank is better in the center. Oh, look. Wow. That is a reasonable move. He's putting pressure on the pin piece. He's also mumbling the word bishop. I'm going to play knight h four. It's not the best move, but knight h four attacks the queen, and the best move is queen f six. All right, well, okay. He thought he was mating me. I guess if you just survive a little bit against musk chess, if you survive a little bit against this magnus, he's going to hang his queen against you. Okay. Discovered. Check. He said stop. No. I hope they discuss these voice lines with him. I gave up my rook, by the way, but the idea there was to get my bishop around. I am a queen up, so I should just go for his king. I can probably sacrifice and continue the attack, because, again, I am up a lot of material. Oh, he doesn't even take. Do I have a checkmate? I do. I have 98 discovered. Check. Okay, 98 discovered. Check. And then I'm going to play bishop f four, queen d seven, and, yeah, I destroyed him. So the first bot is not really that impressive. Let's see if he says anything. You beat sleep. Thank you. Thank you. Chess.com. I can beat a grandmaster when he's asleep. He didn't even say anything when he lost. All right, that was a little bit boring. Let's play ski, Magnus. Magnus is hitting the slopes in 24, but still has time for chess. See how strong he is while he slaloms downhill. What is a slalom? Wait, I got to look this up. Slalom, slalom skiing. Alpine skiing, and what? What is a slalom? Sl A-L-O-M-I don't know. Let's play black. All right. There's no such thing as bad snow, only bad skiers. I'm going down a double black diamond ski run. All right, Magnus, no need to show off. Let's play a modern. Let's play g six and bishop g seven. He turns it back into a king's pawn. I'm going to play d six, a six, b five, maybe. There's two setups that white can choose. He could choose the aggressive one, or he could castle short side. How many other chess players have you seen play chess while skiing? We get it, Magnus. You're very impressive. That's a jerry move if I ever saw one. What looks like a pawn avalanche coming my way. This is not a good move. It was good there. It was good here, and then this is just a waste of time, because I can just attack the knight. I can also keep developing. As long as you're making a move that creates a threat and doesn't overextend your position, it's totally okay. Like a five there is bishop takes in some positions. I don't know what is going on here, but I'm just playing in the modern style. Generally, you try to prepare this move, c five, which is what I'm doing with my night pawn and my rook and skiing Magnus is clearly on some sort of narcotics because he just played bishop e two and bishop f one. I hear there's a secret Magnus bot at the bottom the mountain. Seems sketchy to me. The ski putt troll might need to save you. What is this? The secret Magnus bot? I hear there's a secret magnus bot at the bottom of the mountain. Okay. This is an awful move, Pontex. So skiing Magnus gave me a pawn. I guess I'll continue to develop. I'm trying not to block my bishops. Does that move have a threat? Doesn't look like it. I can attack the knight. I can also break in the center. I guess that move does have a threat, just not with the knight. All right, let's play a five. Now, this is actually not a terrible move if I fall for it. Okay. Doesn't let me quite get what I want. Maybe queen here. I doubt he's going to see that. There's no way. Oh, said gnarly. I don't think Magnus Carlson has literally ever said the word gnarly, but no problem. Let's just castle. Let's just castle. Everything is protected. White doesn't have a lot of space. D five is a queen hang. But there's no need to do that. Let's play f five. We're castled. We're very well equipped to open up the board right now. In general, in a more or less closed position, you are able to open up like this, especially because the opponent's pieces are all back here. Anytime a pawn moves, you want to see what it did. This move actually does a lot of things. First of all, it controls some squares, but it relinquishes defense of this pawn. Second of all, it blocks the bishop. Third of all, it opens the queen. So every time a pawn moves, many, many things happen. In this particular case, white is in a lot of trouble because he's going to lose the knight and then maybe the rook. My pawn moved. Okay, the computer spotted that, but now my pawn made it all the way down the board. It is also very well protected. Now, I'm just looking. I have to be a little careful here with my king, but in general, I don't have any on passant there, sadly. We can trade and then trade the queens. It's a nice way to play for a win. Okay, the computer at this point is completely malfunctioning, so we're going to trade queens because I don't want skiing Magnus to checkmate me. I'm hitting this. Actually, I think I just lost a pawn. Yeah, I might have just lost a pawn, but I have too many pawns. Yeah, this is coming down. It was easier to focus when I was on the chairlift. Oh, now he's saying he's not even focusing. Zvishenzug in between move I'm going to promote to a knight against the bot. So it's check, and I want to disrespect it. This is the only chance I'll get to promote to a knight against Magnus Carlson and actually feel good about myself. It's hard to play chess while holding ski. Tremendous, tremendous, tremendous. Yes. Yes. What does that mean? That there's a secret magnus at the bottom of the mountain. What is he talking about? That's mate. Okay, get my bishop out of the way. Take the pawn. Made him. Okay, take the knight, put the bishop back. Take the pawn. Made him. Take the pawn and made him. That's what we're going for. Oh, my God. Okay. Checkmate. Net. He can't escape. He can't escape. Oh, my God, he's so annoying. I really stomped out Magnus. No, you didn't. What's the. Okay, check. He's gonna go here. And now we prevent his escape. This is how you weave a check. It's normally a stalemate, but he has pawn moves. Made him very convincing. Victory for Mr. Gotham chess. Thank you very much. Maybe I should stick to the bunny slope during our rematch. Yes. You're trash. All right. Magnus loves soccer. He might be a little bit distracted. This whole thing is just him being distracted while he plays you. So he has a built in excuse. We need drunk Magnus. That's what we need. I guess that's not very kid friendly. Can we have apple juice, Magnus? Can we have happy? Hey, chess.com. Call him happy hour Magnus, because kids are going to think that he's just happy. But we all know what that means. It's hard playing soccer while playing chess on your phone. He literally. Okay. Oh, my God. I'm going to go d four this time. I'm going to play a London against Mr. Magnus. All right, I'm playing goalkeeper. Right now, our regular goalkeeper is out sick. Nobody asked. Literally no one asked. What? Okay, that's pretty funny. Soccer. Magnus. Why am I not. What? What is. What is e five? He's 15 under. He hung a pawn on move two. What is this? Oh, my God. Okay, now we're just playing a London, but I have an extra pawn. Oh, my God. What? Martin Odegaard. Is that, like, a slur? Like what? Oh, my. Oh, my God. What is that word? I don't even know who that is. Don't get distracted by me naming random soccer players. Yo, why do they make Magnus look so antisocial in these things? I'm stopping. Queen before check. It's actually not, like, the worst position in the world for black. Let's just be solid. We're playing a London. In the London, you're generally supposed to develop and then put the Knights out. Sometimes people get very spooked in londons when their opponents play very aggressively. Oh, Holland. I know who Holland is. I'm a pawn up. So I'm going to trade the queens. I have to worry a little bit about my bishop getting red card. No. Boo. Wow, they've really made him completely demented. I mean, these voice lines are okay, I guess I can keep developing, or I can start poking with my pawns like this. Anyway, again, up material. Good to trade. Just have to evaluate if he's going to be able to trap your pieces. I can poke at him. I can castle long. I can develop my knight to e two, and then castle short. Just have to again make sure that my bishop is never getting trapped. Okay, so now the best thing to do is to fight back on the dark squares, right? And so now my dark squares are very nice, so my knight could always go there. It's very tough to say which way to castle is better. Actually, I think castling queenside is the better move here, because the rook should guard the pawn. If you castle this way, black might be able to mobilize toward your weakness. In chess, you really got to think of things that way. Can your opponent make forward progress with these pieces? Your king's lining up for a corner kick. It's time to bring a man on late. Okay, I'm going to trade. I'm going to replace the knight where the bishop used to stand. Orion, I don't even. Who is that? I almost miss taking Magnus. Almost missed taking a bishop. Yeah, that's 1500 Magnus. They're insulting Magnus and one five hundreds when they do this. Okay, my knight is powerful on f four. I am a pawn up. Let's jump the knights into the black position just to apply pressure. We don't have any specific targets, but they are very annoying. They're very menacing. And the next order of business might be to poke with the pawns. Oh, that's just a fork. What? He just walked into a fork. He's going to say some stupid thing now this rook's done playing defense. Yeah. Bye. Mohammed el Yunusi. Okay, he's norwegian because he kind of sounds arabic. Who is that? Mohammed El Yunusi. He plays as a forward or winger for Danish. He's born in Morocco. Oh. He might be moroccan, but he plays for the Norway team. Wow, that's confusing. That is. And pardon my ignorance, I mean, my goodness. Wow. Okay. Moroccan, but plays for the danish club team, but on the norwegian national team. Wow. I'm learning things. That's awesome. Look at me. I'm learning stuff. I didn't want to lose that pawn, by the way. So where are these hints? I mean, they were giving me hints for the secret bot, and then they stopped. Okay, I guess I'm going to lose this pawn or not. And now I just need to. It's a very closed position, so I'm going to have to. I will happily trade. He's still naming football players. They made this Magnus play chess like a literal nine year old. Like, nine year olds at chess tournaments. Sit there just drumming. If anybody has actually been to a chess tournament like that is how kids behave, and it is very embarrassing. All right, let's go here. Let's trade. Marcus Hondren Peterson. Amazing. He's still going. That's a double check. Now I'll double the rooks. I'll bring my pawn forward. I'm not playing this, actually that precisely, but I need to do a little bit of a better job. Double up on the file. I also have the outside pass pawn, which is very, very, very valuable. In the end game. I blundered that. That is a fork, and that is very annoying. But let's beat Magnus in an endgame. Let's beat him in a rook endgame. It's the only time in my life I will be able to say I beat Magnus Carlson in a rook end game. I'm two pawns up in a rook end game. I have an outside pass pawn. I'm going to walk my king over here, and I'm going to cook Magnus Carlson. That's what I'm about to do. King F. One. King E. One. King here. King here. He can't stop me. There's nothing. Oh, my God. This must be what it feels like to be Magnus. Just cooking everybody in these endgames. I'm going to bring my king all the way up to. Oh, I got two pass pawns now. A h. You can't beat me now, Magnus. I'm too am. Look at me. I'm the best endgame player of all time. Now king. Oh, I hung that pawn too. Actually. That was pretty stupid, but he can't stop both pawns. Is he going to go here he is. He is going to go there. Let's just take as many pawns as we can to go. Yeah, he can't stop all my pawns. I'm going to take this. Take this. He just doesn't have enough pawns. There we go. Now I just have to not stalemate him. And I am pretty bad at with those. All right, I'm looking forward to playing, like, the 2000 version and the higher one, because they've really made the 1501 brain dead as well. Let's make rooks. Let's just disrespect Magnus a little bit. Pre move. Pre move. Pre move. Pre move. Yep. And we'll promote to another rook. And we're going to win like this. This is where we're going to cut the king off. We're going to stop the promotion, and we're going to get a ladder, mate. Just can't let him sneak in a queen. Every move should be a check. You know what? Just for good measure, I'm just going to go eat the pawn, because you never know. All right. Doink. Doink, doink. Oh, good defense. That was good. That was good. Doink. Doink. Solid game. Did he say anything else? No. No hints. I don't even know. I don't know. I have no idea what they wanted. Chef Magnus cooking up a tour de force dinner for his friends, but still has time. Magnus doesn't cook food. He has a chef. Stop it. All right, last game, I played a modern. This game I'll play. Guess I'll just play something. Don't call me Magnus. Call me chef. Okay, chef. Okay, this is Magnus after getting a head injury skiing. Okay, he's still clarifying. He wants to be called chef. That's weird behavior. It's a queen's pond game. He's gonna play a London. No, he plays whatever that boring. I guess I'm playing a reverse London. That's what I'm. Oh, I missed the voice line. What did he just say? I missed the line. It's not telling me what he said. What did he say? No, go back. Fine. Okay, keeping attention here. Chef boy. Rd. Mama Celeste. One king on. What the. What is he saying? Okay, let's trade this off. Is he going to go here? This is not that. He's just naming chefs, that's what. Rest in peace, by the way, Anthony Bourdain. Is he going to go here? Is that the big idea? Make a reservation. Make a reservation with another bot after this? Maybe one all the way down the page. What are they saying? What are they saying? Down the bot page? Is that what they're saying? I'll whip up a tasty night kimbap. What the isn't Kim? Why does Magnus, the norwegian chef, make korean food? What? I'll steal 86 year king from my kitchen. What the. I keep looking things up because I have no idea what they're talking about. Okay, anyway, playing in the center is good. Does Chef Magnus see the pawn is hanging? I could sack, but that might be a little bit too much. I'm not sure my queen has backup there. Let's lock out the bishop. Isn't the bishop trapped? Can't I play a six? B five. Isn't the bishop trapped? Uhoh. Uhoh. Chef Magnus, is that a good move? What if I do this? Wait, can you go uhoh. Uh. Oh, no, I don't think it's an uhoh, because I think I can take. I'm going to get three pawns for the bishop, and I'm still threatening to trap this bozo's bishop over here. Yeah, I can just take it, right? I can just trade and then play b five. Sorry, chef Magnus, you got your bishop trapped. Yeah, I know you want that, but you're not going to get it. You're not going to get it, and your bishop is going to die. Sorry, bud. So now I am three pawns up. Pretty good, pretty good, pretty good. This guy might be worse than the last bot. And now we can just march down the center of the board here. We're not getting trapped, so let's just march in. 95. That doesn't do anything. What was the point of this? There was no threat. Okay, we could trade some pieces. I can also plot my knight. Oh, I got to be careful. I got to not get my piece trapped. So let's just start with h five. This bishop is pretty bad. E four. Nice move. Trade some pieces. Ooh, he's just letting me walk in. I mean, two connected past pawns that deep into the territory is not going to go well. Mr. Magnus. Oh, my goodness. Chef Magnus, I apologize, chef Magnus. Oh, my. Connected pawns on the third rank is game over. E. Don't know. They both look good. D two. E two. I got the rooks behind them. I'm sorry. What can I promote to another knight? I'll promote to a bishop disrespecting the goat. Because I can. Because this. They gave me the chance. Let's eat all his pawns. Put the knight on have. They should not have done this to Magnus because there is no way I can get this level of a victory. Even if Magnus was on his deathbed, I think he would do better than this. All right, takes. Let's clean it up. That'll make a beautiful pawn. Flambey. He's still talking about cooking food. He's getting cooked, and he's talking about cooking food. All right. He can't move. I'm going to put my pawn on f four, and we are going to suffocate the man. That's what we're going to do right now. How do I get a checkmate net? How do I get a checkmate net? Let's give a check, and let's take the pawn. He still has many legal moves. And then I can put my. It's not a stalemate. Not a stalemate. And we need to checkmate him. What's the fastest checkmate here? I probably need to wrap my rook a certain way. This is very annoying. Let's give a check, and then let's go to. That's not made either. Oh, my God. This is very annoying. Knight here, king here. Rook f two. King here. I want the rook on f two, and I want the knight on g four. I think I need the knight on g four. So let's put the knight on g four, and now we set a checkmate. Net. There we go. All right. Thank you for the game. You are now an official chess.com chef. Shut up. All right, last game against Magnus, or I don't know. Is it? All right, let's go. Actual Magnus. 28, 80. I'm Magnus Carlson. Oh, I was waiting for him to move. I'm so starstruck. Okay, let's play d four. I guess I played d four last game, but it's okay. Knight f six. I will play my. I'm the 16th. Okay. Why do all his voice lines just sound so brutally, annoyingly arrogant? Like what? We know. That's why they made bots of you. You don't need to tell us, all right? If I was the World champ, they would have made bots of me. They only have one bot of me. Okay. Anyway, should we play a main line? What should we do? Let's play a mainline. Mainline. D four. C four. Play z six. Play the Catalan, maybe. I missed that voice. I missed that line. What did he say? Queen's Indian. Let's see how long you last. Good luck. Good luck to you, bozo. Don't talk to me like you know me. Okay, this is a line. Queen c two. Oh, my God. I keep missing the lines because they bring them up. This is a fun way of developing. Agreed. Knight bd two. This is the queen's indian. Black. Tries to put pressure with the bishops. I'm quite good in positions with a strong bishop like this also. All. Yeah, same. I had a game like this against Emilio Cordova. I remember I had a game like this. He says shut. Oh, my God. Be quiet. Let's grab the bishop. Let's give up. Okay. It's a little bit scary. The tension is building. Yeah, you and me both. Queen d one. This is a weird move, though, because he's going to have to move the bishop anyway, or he's just choosing not to. I can appreciate a good night every once in a while. What does that even mean? I guess I can play pawn to e three, right? I mean, I don't really want to play pont two. E three. The thing is, if I castle, is he going to take my knight? Is that the idea? He's going to take my knight and then he's going to take on d four. Do I take and then a castle, do I take and then play b four? Really don't like the concept of taking and then giving him the b file. But I also don't want to. And I don't want to play e three because I feel like I'm weakening my position over here a bit. And then he might take this pawn and things like that. Take knight d four. C d four is also quite good. I'm already thinking, let's take. Let's take and then try to open up the position. I mean, I expect rook b eight. No, he didn't. Okay. It's nice of you to take care of your king. Thank you, Magnus. B four. Because I feel like I need to get rid of that weakness. Bishop b two. Take. He can't take with the rook because I have a pin. If knight takes, I have rook take. Let's go. Bishop b two. I like this, actually. I have some nice space. I have open lines. Take. Take. He can't take with the rook. What? I don't think the best move is obvious here. What the. I beg your pardon? What exactly is wrong with the x ray of the rook to the rook? What? He just wants both pawns. He's just giving me. Yeah, I know. Takes. But that's not your voice line, Magnus. That's Hikaru's voice line. Oh, my God. That's a zwichenzuk. I think I'm a lot funnier than the bot version of me. You. You are the man. Okay, my queen is hanging. I have queen d six. At which point he could take. Do I want to play an end game against the Magnus endgame bot? Let's play an end game against the end game Magnus bot. Let's do it. That's not the best move. I don't think that's the best move. I think I need to keep queens on. I don't think I have enough firepower. It. But let's just make a funny point. Let's try to be humorous. Let's try to be humorous. All right. E three. Oh, he said, how dare you. Wait. He said, how dare you? You are stronger than I thought. Is that true? I don't know. I was programmed to say that. That's very funny. Okay, I don't know where the how dare you thing happened, but whatever. E five. This is scary. I'm in an end game against Magnus. Let's play h three. I want to stop the knight from coming to g four. Plays h six. Now, I don't know if I want to trade the rooks. Do I think that I have a good enough position to win with just one rook if I have the king of the rooks? Oh, I think this was a mistake. The real me would probably play a better move, but the bot me will settle for that. I don't think getting the bishop off the center was right. Something tells me this was wrong, because it allows me to start transferring some pieces over rook a two. I'm getting confident that pawn is not instilling a lot of confidence in me. What about Rook a four? Now I'm making the bot play d five. Magnus doesn't like making committal pawn decisions. Your piece must be in good shape with all the moving it's doing. Yeah, you talk more trash, I'm going to ruin your life. How about that clown? My bot is almost 2900. Is there any tougher bot you can find? Whoa. If take knight c five is the idea, can I take and then take the next one? I mean, this has to be right, right? This is what I did do. I have rook a three take here, and then maybe. No, that doesn't. Look, can I take and then, I mean, it's equal, but he has a past. Outside pawn. I don't want to give up my rook for no reason. I don't see a reason to give up my rook for no reason, so I will not be giving up a rook for no reason. Okay, still not fully convinced that this is, like, that. Good for the bot. Rook c one. King d six. Knight c four. Do I want a knight or do I want a bishop? Which piece do I want? Do I want a knight, or do I want a bishop? Which piece do I want to preserve? Which piece is better? Oh, that's so tough. I'm going to say I want to trade the bishop. I don't think my bishop is going to be that good in the long run, and I do think I need my knight. I can take. He's got to take like this. Maybe I have rook c one stuff. Knight c four stuff. Take. Very tough to say. Very tough. If I take, am I. Am I creating an asset for him for the mongoose bot? I don't know. Very, very difficult. King f two. Let's bring the king. Let's not. Let's not rush anything. I respect you for challenging me, but I don't fear you. I mean, I would hope not, Mr. Greatest of all time. Tough. G four. Control some pawns. I don't know. Is this weakening? Like, what is Bishop e two? Very tense position, but, uhoh. Here comes the pawn. Here comes the pawn. I gotta get out of here. I don't know how, though. I can keep walking, my king, but is that fast enough? What if I go here, k goes back. Let's continue to try to get a trade. Maybe he'll go here. Oh, yes. Whoa. That's huge. Wow. The bot decided it couldn't make any more progress a year. Oh, yeah. All right. Yes. That is how we do it. But I'm not finished. I think there is still something. There's still something here, right? Where's the secret bot? Where is the secret bot? New game. Okay, they said at the bottom of this page, there's a chessbot called the Magni, and its elo is impossible. Three Magnus Carlsons. What? How strong is it? Okay, I'll play black. Hello. We are the Magni. We are the ultimate. What the. What is going on? Okay, how good is this thing? We are happy to play. Yo, that's creepy, bro. I don't like that, man. Oh, my goodness. Yeah. And so what we would say, good luck, but luck cannot help you. Queen's gambit accepted. I'm chilling. What the. What? What is that? That's just a mistake. What is that? What? They just gave me a pawn. What was that? That's just a free pawn, and I'm just going to castle. Three out of three. Magna, I agree on castling. Yeah. But you bozos lost a pawn. Okay, but I'm just a pawn. Up. I don't understand. How do you agree the position is equal? You're a full pawn. Down. What is this nonsense gambit that these guys just invented? I'm going to put my knight there. I'm never getting mated. Okay, b six, queen e four. Don't. Don't blunder that. But I just go here. I don't. And we have been the number one chess player in the world for a combined 30 years. Nobody cares. You're upon down. You're not going to mate me, either, if you trade all the pieces. I'll just go here. What? This is terrible. What is this thing doing? Okay, and rookie eight, b six. Now I can play b six because this isn't even a fork. One out of three. Magnite is hungry and wants bro. Just like I'm got too much time on their hands, man. They got too much time on their hands doing this nonsense. The magni have chosen the obvious move. Yeah, you don't say. Queen d six. I don't get it. I'm still up a pawn and just g six. How will I ever lose? Famous last words. But seriously, like, I'm just. I'm. I'm chilling. I am completely chilling. I'm gonna play b six and then Bishop b seven, and I get my bishop out. What is the. Wow. It's still trying to attack me. I don't understand. I don't understand. I can't lose, right? Like, maybe I'll lose an end game or something, but it does. What the. Rook b five is crazy. It wants to go rookie five. But what if I play bishop a six and then I trade bishops? What if I hit him with one of those? Oh, bishop a six, rookie five. Bishop d three. Is this the idea? Okay, let's overprotect my pawn. I need to just find a repetition. That's what I got to do. It's going to triple up. Or that, whatever that does. I think I'm trying to get it to play c four. That's terrifying, because it just did what I thought. We are the Mac. Thank you. I was unsure what your name was because you only said it like 46 times. Yeah, but now what if I just wait? What if I don't do anything? What if I just wait and pressure this pawn? Right? But what if I play like, rook f four, rook d eight, or even bishop d five now. Oh, no, that hangs. A queen. Take, take rookie seven. That would be bad. That would be bad. Rook f four, queen d four, rook f four, rook d eight, maybe rook f four, bishop d five I can take. Now, I don't want to go here because it's like, so depressing, but I might not have a choice. Oh, this is getting very difficult. Let's go. Rook d eight. I guess the mag mat. Uhoh. Three out of three. Magnite. Evaluate this position as advantageous. Uhoh. I can't take. Uhoh, uhoh. Uhoh. Uhoh. I'm still defending. Maybe I'm not defending. Oh, no. Oh, I'm in, I'm in trouble. It's gonna take. Maybe I can go for this pawn. I can't touch anything. It's just not letting me. It's not letting me move. I'm doing what I can to get this epon, but it's just going to defend. Oh, no. Oh, if that works. I'm so cooked. I am so cooked. If that move works, is it gonna take? What's the take? I don't understand. What is the idea? Don't I just take on e six? What? What? How am I. Oh, and now it's gonna kill me. Now it's gonna kill me. Yeah, we are the magni. That was nuts. It just straight up played a gambit. I've never seen that in my life. All right, let's get. Oh, wait, that doesn't even work. Oh, but that works. The magnite have selected the best move. I can't take because I lose my queen. It's threatening Bishop c two. I can't defend against that unless I play rook c six. And if I play rook c six, it forks me, and my king has no legal moves. Maybe queen g five. Last chance. I think I must be lost. Queen. Oh, and now it's going to sneak in. Brutal. And it's mate. No, it's not mate. What? Thought I was mated. Oh, it's just going to take my bishop. It's not taking my bishop. It's going to take my bishop with check. Or that. Yeah, check. And that's the end because I don't have this. Oh, I don't have any checks. And I'm going to play rook there and get mated. Wow. Okay. They did not get satisfied with one Magnus, so they straight up invented a bot that is three Magnus Carlsons. And what does the game review say? And what does the game review say? Me against three Magnus freaking carlsons. That's what we're working with here. My game review is on the highest setting, so it's going to take a little bit of time. I mean, if e four is like, what even was that? That was the Magni versus Gotham chess. Magnus Carlson bots are here. Chess.com. I kindly advise you to add a happy hour, Magnus. Maybe some others long video today, but I do hope you appreciated it. E four was a bad move, right? E four is a mistake. So I guess it plays in a way where it gives away a little advantage early, and then it just bulldozes. I mean, I was doing okay, but I guess it just has a really aggressive playing style. I was fine. It was equal, and then where did I make a mistake? Queen d seven, I guess, was a bad move. Rook d eight was a bad move. Yeah. Wow. My estimated Elo was 2900, and it was 34 50. So I can't really hate. I'm pretty proud of myself. That's all I got for you today. I'm going to try to play a couple of different challenges versus these Magnus bots. It's going to be a fun January. My friends, friendly reminder once again. Last day to get 40% off, and I'm going to grind against these Magnus bots and try to farm them for content for the next 31 days. So get out of here.
