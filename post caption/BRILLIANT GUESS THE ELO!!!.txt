Ladies and gentlemen. Oh, this is a water bottle. Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to your favorite series on the Internet, guess the Elo. If you're new to this series, this is a series where I take my subscriber games while I'm live on Twitch. I analyze them without knowing their chess strength, and then I try to estimate their chess Elo, and I compare it to chess Com's game review. Normally, this is extremely ridiculous and chaotic and stupid and bad and entertaining. But in this episode, we had some brilliant moves. We had some extremely high quality chess. You're going to learn, you're going to laugh. But of course, it wouldn't be guess the elo if we didn't have a circus. Also, stay tuned for the later games in this video because you are not going to believe your eyes. Enjoy. We are never going to get the same magic that we got last time. We are never going to get it. And already the Gotham sub plays an opening I do not support. Bishop to b 597. This is called the cozio defense, the cozio variation of the rule. Lopez. I don't think anybody knew that who was participating in this game. But just in case, d three is completely fine. Although in this opening, you are supposed to play c three and d four. Like, that is really what you're trying to do. But this is fine. Bishop a four. Obviously, the idea is to do this. This. So you should not take. Good. Okay, castle. Okay. It's still like. Okay. All right. Yeah, this is a wee bit uga for me. This is a bit weird. I mean, it's still fine. Now, my friend, should you trade the bishop or not? Is a very tough question. I would say don't trade because your bishop is of a higher quality. It's actually got. Okay, all right. And now, yeah, b four is triple digit stuff. Or, like, very low four digit stuff. Now, the second that. Black castles, white. Also castles. Very funny. Right? Like, white plays great opening. Doesn't castle. Doesn't castle. Because the bishop was hanging. Doesn't castle. Doesn't castle. Trades. The bishop chases the knight. Doesn't castle. Oh, I got a castle. Right. Knight G six is apparently a mistake. Yeah. So, opposite side castling. If any of you have the middle games masterclass, your brain will just immediately be wired. That is the whole point of taking my courses. You don't have to take my courses to watch Castillo, but your brain will just be like, oh, opposite side castling. So what's a good move here? That prepares an attack? You want to play a four, b five, a lot of you would just go here. I would like to take with a pawn, though. So you would play a four, but then you would hang the pawn. So let's play rookie one. Right. There you go. Or night. Or night D five to defend that. But. All right. Knight G five is just not playing on the right side of the board. Excellent plan. Now, this is also just not a good move because you removed a main defender, and now we have c six. There is Knight B six. Okay. A four, b five. Just go for an attack. Okay. Don't hate that move. Free pawn. Fantastic. A four. B five. C four, b five. Oh. Knight B six. Okay. Wow. You don't need to do that. I mean, you could just go here. Or triple. Triple, triple. All right, so we're starting. Guess the elo. Okay. They even know on passon. Okay, now I'm back to thinking it's quadruple the digits. Oh, my God. Removing the defender. Look at this. Bishop takes Knight Queen c six on the way. Wow. Why did you submit this game? This is a very interesting question, by the way. There was pawn b seven. Was. Was brutal. But okay, that was just. I mean, you just killed him. I don't even. Wow. I have a feeling it's a three, three digit elo game or a very low, like 1000 or something. Because, again, my theory is that this is a game submitted by a low rated player who wants to be hyped up. And I mean, the Spanish, right? Like Rulopez, maybe 1200. Black playing whatever on earth. This is like night before is weird. That's a weird move. And then a three, b four is weird. The tunnel vision, not castling. I'm going to say 1100. That just seems like a safe guess. I don't know if it seems like a safe guess to y'all. It seems like a safe guess to me. That's just what I think. I mean, it really. Let's see. 1100 ish. 813. Blitz. 800. Wow. Damn. Sagar. Okay, well, his username is 1395, so he's playing the way he wants to play. And what does chess.com think? 1300. Okay, so I said 100. Chesscom thinks you're 1300. Wow. And yeah, your opponent, unfortunately got white overpowered. Yeah, white op. Didn't need the political views of the game review there. And that's a little bit weird. Maybe you should get a bit more well adjusted game review anyway. That's a joke. Guess the elo. Guess the elo. Screen. Yes. Game two now. Wow. That was unbelievable. I mean, that might have been the best game you've ever played. I don't know why I had to sound a bit irish there. Ah, okay. Game number two. That. That was a. That was a good start. I mean, my God, that was a high level game of chess. Okay, Scandi, take queen d five. Scandi is one of the easiest openings to learn. You can learn the Scandinavian in 60 seconds. It's basically put the queen here. You develop your pieces and try to castle. And if they try to go after your queen, the second they start doing that, you play c six, and you get away. Like, that's. That's literally it. So good. Okay. So black doesn't know what they're doing. They don't know how to play this opening. Black, you're not supposed to do that. You're supposed to go here. If white ever does this, you make a getaway. You put the pawns, you put the bishop, put the knight like that, and then you castle. Okay, c five is not a huge mistake, but it's just not a good move because you can play d five. Wow. Holy moly. We're off to a good start today. No, we're not. I take that back. Wow. Yeah. This is not. I mean, you can't learn an opening like this and not know it past the third move. Fourth move. But I think the fourth move, I mean, c five, e five is crazy. That is the cleanest free pawn of all time. Now, you got a passer, and you're a pawn up, and you got knight c four. Yeah. I would stay aggressive, right? I would stay aggressive, but I don't hate this move. Now, a lesson for the beginners. Beginner chess lesson. If you have not castled yet and you still need to move a bishop to castle, but your opponent has castled always, and I mean always, be careful of this. Check. So the best move here is probably bishop here, because if you play bishop here, you're probably going to have to go back. And if you block with this bishop, your bishop is just going to be a target. So Bishop D three, rookie eight. And now one of these two moves. This is a bit spooky, because knight g four, the computer thinks it's fine, because after knight g four, it's completely unafraid of this. But for the beginners, it's just good to have that in mind. That doesn't happen. I don't know what this even begins to do. I would just play h three, queen c seven. And this is called the fishing pole. That's called the fishing pole. And this is something that you can do if your opponent has castled, but you have not, so that when they take, you have a rook. This is not the fishing pole. This is you falling off the boat with the fishing rod. This is not a real thing. This is not a real thing. That. Now there is no actual attack whatsoever. That's just a free bishop. Okay. Yeah. There is nothing here. I mean, if these two could do like a flipperoni jutsu, then maybe. Yeah. Now black goes g six. And white just traps the bishop. Yeah. And wins it, too. Wow. Both bishops died there. That's incredible. And just 94. Good. I would fight back on the h file, trade the rook. Queen got to be trapped somehow. Yep. Rook h check is good. Take the pawn. What is this episode? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. It's a little bit. Getting a little uga now. A little bit uga, but okay. Don't panic. Nice. Protect the king at all times. Go check. Very important move. Oh, he found it. Wow. Wow. That was weird. That was a weird one. Like, black played horribly. White played. What is this episode today? Y'all stop messing around, man. Y'all really just playing really good moves. This was really nice. Took the center, took the pawn castle, defended your king, called the bluff, and just calmly trapped the bishop. Now, black's best move here is to take and to try to do this. And, I mean, as long as you don't panic. Just look where they have a check. You can even bring the bishop back to g one, probably. Then there's queen h four, but maybe bishop f two. There's no queen h. There's no check. No check. Queen has to leave. Yeah. And then another very important lesson. F three. Very high level move. Very high level move. Understanding to defend this. And right here. A lot of people would freak out with all this coming. They might try to block the king. Queen e five is a nice and cerebral move. And of course, black blundered. I'm going to say, like 1400. I think this is like a one three, 1400 level game. I really think so. Let's see, 1680. How is black that high rated? What? 1680 is. Is ridiculous. Oh, no. Nah. I mean, white played well, but what? Yo, black was smoking something. I mean, that is. Wow. Yeah, white got 1750 credit. Black fourth. Black was hot. 1450. Yo, find me a 1450 on planet Earth that plays e five. Was that a mouse slip? But this was also crazy, just, like, losing the bit. I mean, my friends, can I just say something? Can I. Y'all get me so tight, bro. Can I say something real quick? Yo, hold up. Hold up. Why are you starting a 15 minutes game and ending the game with 17 minutes on the clock? What is wrong with you? What is the matter with you? This is why y'all never get better. Y'all want to play that fast? Play bullet. Play three minute. You better be the world champion of blitz. What the hell is the matter with you? Why are you giving yourself 15 minutes on the clock to have 17 minutes at the end? I mean, I. I don't even know what to say. I don't even know. Somebody just donated $15 and said my birthday is coming up. Should you ask your wife for Chessley courses? Sure. We're in the middle of recording. Do you see what catastrophe we're looking at? Oh, God. He ended with nearly two minutes more on the clock. Guys, this is why you don't get better. This is why you don't get better, because. What are you doing? Why? Oh, my goodness. Yeah. Ask her for a course. Ask her to get you a course. We used to have gifting. We turned that off for now. We're going to offer a different alternative. How much are the courses? I'm not telling you. It takes you 10 seconds to research that. And as I always say, if you can't be bothered to begin the research for a course, you don't actually want the course. I try to make you put in the work. Nice. Wow. Sensational stuff. Where do you send the games? I don't know. Send them to your local post office. D. Queen's gambit accepted. Okay. E four. Lot of different stuff to play against this. I would not play that. If you're going to play the queen's gambit accepted. This is the only thing that's scary. Like, you have to know what you're doing here. The way you play this is you play e five, you don't play c five. You could play c five, but it's not the best move. Got to strike back because then they lose their right to Castle. This is not a good move because they're going to take the center, and I don't think you're good enough to deal with this. Yep. You're not okay. But neither is white. I mean, like, this is a. This is Queen's gambit 101. Bishop C four is okay. Takes. You could take that. These positions always confuse intermediate players because they don't know. Like, do they take? Do they just develop? If you don't have to take, you don't need to. But taking is also okay as long as the queen's not causing you any harm. Now, I would just go here and castle. Okay. Night f three. Do I coach still? Absolutely not. No, I coach the Internet. Now, develop the rest of the pieces. Maybe v five is interesting. Okay, that's a little slow. Oh, you're trying to go here. This is a crazy amount of tunnel vision. I mean, this is a crazy amount of tunnel vision. I mean, this. This is wild. I mean, like, look at this. Come on. I think black is struggling here because of the congestion. And I don't blame you. I would try to get your pieces out a different way, like knight a six night before. Try to lead with your pieces. Right. C five is hanging. No, it's definitely not hanging. C four is hanging. But it's kind of not hanging because there's this. There's, like, this stuff. Anyway, Bishop H seven. And white goes here, which is a bad move, because if you follow the rules of checks, captures, and attacks in this position, you will find the best move for black. Will we have a sale any. I'm trying to record guests the elo. I mean, listen, I love y'all, but, like, you're just feeding. Are we gonna have a sale? Gotham. Is there gonna be a sale on the Gotham. Earth to Gotham? Stop the recording. Is there gonna be a sale? Just let me finish. It's not that important for me to address that at this very moment. Probably will be. Probably. Let me finish. We're analyzing, doing guess the elu here. See, that's what I like about YouTube. They just watch. They can't interrupt. Why are the courses $300? Bro, this dude is on another website entirely. That dude is on a different website. Courses, $300. If you follow the philosophy of checks, captures, attacks, you'll realize. You'll realize that there are no checks. There are no captures that make sense, but attacks. Bishop is trapped. Okay, you're down two pawns. You're starting your own attack. I like this. I don't hate it. Now, white should probably trade the queens. Trade the queens. Okay, now you're getting. See, look how easy the game is once your pieces start flowing. 95. Oh, that's pretty wild. He sacrificed the rook. Wow. I mean, it doesn't work, but it's the thought that counts. The idea is this and then that. Now, unfortunately, white gets moves, too. So he can play, like, queen d three, queen d four. She could play queen d three. Queen d four. Queen g four, by the way, hits this and this. Good. Queen g four or queen d four. Check. Great move. Take the knight. Wow. Yep. Oh, you are never winning this. Queen E. That's all right, white's gonna win. Queen f four. Queen H four. Now, the craziest part is, this is still losing. The craziest part is, this is still losing. Even if you lose the rook, if the king just went to g one, it's just d eight. Queen. You lost the queen. You lost the rook. You're still winning. Oh, man. That's how bad your position was, bud. Oh, man. All right, check. Now, let's just not blunder. A checkmate king just runs to safety. Don't run forward. All right, you're fine. Stop running forward. Thank you. Yo, yo, yo. Go to stop and just hide. Oh, my God. He hung that. Credit to the Gotham subscriber for not resigning, but. Oh, dear Lord. Oh, God. Oh, my. That was incredible. Dude was losing the whole time. Literally just the whole. He was. Black was losing for 56 moves, but one in 57. I don't even know what the Elo is, man. That's crazy. I got. I have no idea. I mean, I still think that a good amount of control was demonstrated. I mean, it's got to be like a thousand, right? Got to be like a thousand. I mean, this was creative. I mean, a 1000 would not find that. No. Yeah, I'm thinking a bit higher, maybe. Oh, one more thing. Queen a four. Check would not be played by anybody below, like, 1500. People below 1500 don't even know queens can move that far. So I'm gonna say, like. I'm gonna say, like, 1600. Like 15. 1600. That's my guess. Let's see. This time I was wrong. 1000. Damn. No, a. I straight up thought everybody thus far was good. These guys happen to be lower rated. Nothing I can do about that. Also, guys, why are you mad? All right? It doesn't matter if you're 1600 or a thousand. Y'all all garbage anyway, man. Y'all all play like this, too. Stop it. That's offensive. Have you seen some of the games that have been submitted? Talking about offensive. Crazy. All right, Gotham sub. All right. Scotch. Scotch declined. Okay. Taking queen. Trade takes the knight. Okay? This is either, like, an 1800, who's damaging the pawn structure of the. Of the opponent, or this is like an 800, who's just taking pieces. Okay. Castles. Okay. Typical 900 level play. Wow. Defending the. Oh, this is. This is a lot of information, right? This is four digits right here for sure. Wow, look at that. Bring the rook to the center. Oh, the other knight is going. Maybe c four. Oh, I like that. Okay, rook f two will give a lot of information. Rook f two. Rook d two is like a 1500 level maneuver. If you play rookie one, you're like, eleven, 1200. B three, c four. Oh, damn. Now I'm, now I'm kind of back thinking this might be 1500. Oh, good. Light, square setup. And now this is a backwards pawn. Now maybe knight f two and double the rooks. How are we doing? No, that's not. No, what are you doing? Stop. What is black doing? What is black? Oh, rook d six. Oh, he snuck it through. G four was completely idiotic. But black just let the pawn go. Black never took. Black just never took the pawn back. What. What is rook b seven? What is that? That's a crazy move. Oh, I guess this is the idea. But for some reason, they just look staged. I mean, the opening was sophisticated, damaging the structure. Good play. I told you, this f three move, replacing the knight, anticipating that the knight would be hit. Right. That's an anticipating move. If this h six, you're going to lose the pawn, probably is what white thought. Yeah. Knight g five. F three is wild. I'm thinking 1300. I'm thinking 1200 with some, with some stupidity toward the end. But let's see, 1500. Wow. Even higher. Oh, and I realized I never did this for the last game. For the last game when I said 1600. So let me, let me see. What does chess.com think of the last game? The thing is, chess.com is going to give an estimate close to their ratings. Right. All right. It said they were both 1193% by white. 2200 estimate. Wow. 1800 now. Well done. Wow. Wow. Impressive stuff. That was a good game. Yeah, I didn't think it was any higher. Like, I didn't think it was 50. See, this is a 1600 level game, and you guys are like, don't insult the 16 hundreds. Why did the 1600 play rookie seven and just allow the pawn to become a queen? Right like that? Strange, strange stuff. Rookie six was definitely nice. Yes, that was definitely nice. Okay, last game. Very nice. Little calm. Guess the Elo episode this time. All right. Net of six. Have I ever missed a tactic? Never in my life, Bono. Wow. 2000 minimum. Wow. This is way too professional. H three to play knight f three to prevent the pin. H three is not a great move, but it makes sense. Wow. What? Can somebody hang something? Queen c seven is a very bad move. Why night b five? Okay, yeah, hanging queen c seven is good information. It's probably like 1500 and below. I mean, you just can't. Yeah, that's like a night. B five is a very natural thing to spot. People love these, these night jumps. B three bishop b two. Wait a minute. My brain was like, oh, black castled. My brain didn't realize they castled long. What? Why? Holy shit. Just castle short. What the heck? For what? Get king b eight. But now knight b five. Now you're just inviting problems. Now white is going to take and. Oh, God. Rook c one. Oh, this is. You got no attack of your own. Where are you? Attack. Who are you trying to attack? Oh, you're going to lose your queen. You're going to lose your queen. You're going to lose a three. Bishop B five. Bishop B one. You're going to lose your queen. Oh, you're going to lose your queen. You're going to lose your queen. Okay. You're not going to lose your queen anymore. A move ago, you might have lost your queen. Yeah, now it's manageable. But I think you're going to lose something. This is just so unplugged. Oh, now you're pinned. The bishop gone is actually a very welcome sight. But it's still better for. For white because the knight is so much better than the bishop. Unless you hang your rook. Yeah, unless you hang your rook. And you're. I mean, knight b five was just night. Okay, good defense. Good defense. Better offense, but not actually in this case. Rook c eight. Oh, they're untangling. Oh, check, check. Queen C four. And apparently queen f one was winning. I like this. Wow, look at this. Unstoppable force meets an immovable object. Queen B. Oh, that's nice. Apparently. Oh, you had queen b five and 96. That's very difficult. Oh, my God. Wow. Queen E four, looking for the queen. Oh, that's it. Now black's winning. White just resigned. White resigned here. Okay. Very decent opening. Very decent opening. But night b five, and, I mean, just some really boneheaded decisions here. Like, night b five is crazy. You cannot allow that. But black was good. I mean, black got into a very stupid situation and then just defended unpinning. Bringing the second rook. You have to understand, the best move for black in this position is to bring the second rook. This is wrong because technically, you're, like, losing pawns here and then just being cerebral, just defending the right way and everything. That was a decent game of chess. That was a really decent. I mean, but still, like, how. How low rated do you have to be to allow knight B five? Because black could have easily lost this game a hundred times. Queen a six back, right? Bringing the queen backwards. Bringing the knight backwards. Playing this. Bringing the rook, man. Like, a lot of decent. Like Bishop there. But I have to think, was any of this that complicated? Right? Was any of this really that complicated? Queen. Before trying to trade the queen, it was all very kind of close combat. Then, when in doubt, you just started shoving all of your pawns forward. I mean, was this brilliant or an accident? Brilliant or an accident? I'm gonna say, like, I'm. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna say 17 1800. I'm gonna say 17 1800. But allowing night b five, which is it, would a 17 1800 allow night b five, would a 17 1800 survive that long? 1350. Final answer, 13:50 a.m.. I. Right. 2200 versus 21 91. No blitz. Not even bullet. No, no. Oh, no. Oh, God. I. Oh, God. I thought. I mean, I really thought 17 1800, but I just didn't think. I just didn't think that 21. Oh, God. Oh, okay. No problem. No problem. It happens, you know, it happens to the best of us. I mean, just look at me. What did chess.com think? Chess.com, I think, has been programmed to not insult the players. I think chess.com is going to say, like, an 1800 game. I don't think chess.com is going to say any lower than that. Okay. In my defense, that was my guess. I said 17 1800. Yeah, chess comp thought, you know, I mean, chess.com still thought black played better than white, but. Oh, man. Yeah, it was very difficult. Look, the reason Hikaru and Magnus are so much better than and everybody, particularly at speeches, is their ability to defend and not lose. And I really felt like black's ability in this game to defend and not lose was very high, which is why I was saying 17. So I got to trust myself because I started saying 17 1800, and then you guys in the chat, and I already made a really bad guess, you guys in the chat start going, no, it's not, you idiot. And then I'm like, well, maybe they're right. Maybe it's a 1350 game.
