Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to your favorite series on the Internet, guess the Elo. Many of you have already been watching the series for a very long time. If you're newer in this series, I take my subscriber games on chess.com. I analyze them blindly and then I try to guess what rating they are at chess and I compare it to chess. Com's game review every episode. This series has something unique. This episode is probably the worst one by far. The games are of a atrocious quality. My guesses were off by 500 to a thousand points in literally every game. And there is a grandmaster game in this video and I predicted it so much lower than that Elo. So please enjoy this episode. And before we jump into the games, I'd like to thank the sponsor of today's video, Rocket money. Folks, I've got a question. Do you have any idea how many subscriptions you're paying for?

The sicilian defense. The Smithmore gambit. Okay, is this, is this white thinking that this is a danish gambit? Cause this is a danish gambit and there's no epawn, so you can't play e six. It makes a lot less sense to do this now because I can just play e six. You understand that's the difference? This is not as good because the bishop doesn't. Okay, but black is chicken. What is this? I mean, that's not a move. Now, 95 is probably just really good. I mean, you can even take, but that's, that's a really dangerous move to play. Okay, just fine developing and. Damn. F four. Oh, my God. They messed around for too long. How are you going to play a gambit, bro? In a gambit, you're supposed to lose a pawn or two. This is the giga uga gambit, where in the first ten moves, you've lost two pawns a night and a rook. This is not how chess works. This is the giga uga gambit. Okay, I don't know what you did here, but you don't have a lot of pieces. Oh, my goodness. What is white? Oh, God. And black doesn't take. Why is this pawn still here? Thank you. Okay, now, we need to do something. And I understand there is on passant, but night before, and then you get the pawn back, and white is ill equipped to defend this position. You can play queen a five and queen b six, and stop castling, but. Okay. Oh, come on, dude. Dude, I have a feeling. Okay, this is obviously three digit chess. Now, you could tell because black is like, me take pawn, me move queen to attack pawn. Oh, white defend pawn, me move knight to attack queen. Now, black doesn't know what to do, so black goes here, which doesn't do anything. And now black goes here. And now is the queen trapped? Oh, they hung the knight. Oh, they hung the knight. Yes. Big comeback time. Nice. Knight back to c six. For reasons I can't fully explain. You think black is ever going to get the bishop out? Do you think black is ever going to get this Bishop out with, like, b six? Oh, yes, the bishop is coming out. But here comes white with the mega giga omega attack. Oh, no, the queen is running back. But now look at white opening up the position. Queen slides up to e three, rook to f eight. Beautiful move, losing the rook. White got scared, though. Unpinning. Okay, now, how is the rook just. Why are you pushing pawns where white has a rook, a knight, a bishop, a queen, and another bishop. White has 23 points of material staring this way, and you're just like, I don't care, idiot. You're not going to. Oh, that happened. So black found a way to lose a rook in a different fashion. Okay, rook f five is the top engine move. Do you think black knew that or what? Do you think they knew that? Or you think that's just lucky. It's a top engine move because this bishop is such an important member of this attack. All right. Oh, and that happened. Ooh. E six. Huge move. Horrible move. By the way, take the night. No, take the knight. Oh, the rook is coming. Oh, here comes the rook now. How are you going to make a little thing for the rook and then just not bring the rook, bro. 95. What? That just hangs a knight. Okay. Oh, not. None of these move. None of these moves are good. What is going. A rook c seven. But. Oh, the haymaker bishop e four was made in one. Okay, that was nuts. That was nuts. What a game. None of those moves were good. I mean, literally none. Like, look at this. Horrible move. Horrible move for white. Incredible top engine move by black, by the way. E six. Black is winning de. White is equal queen f seven. White is winning rook h three. White is losing 95. White is winning, 97. It's still kind of equalish. Oh, my goodness. Yeah, my friends, this is just a good lesson in the fact that you should probably go backwards, but king f one. There is this. So, yeah, I mean, I don't blame you. It's got to be a three digit game, right? Okay, but White tried to play a real opening. Or maybe they didn't. Maybe they didn't try to play a real opening. Okay, this is either like 1500 bullet or 700. Anything else? I think this is 1500 bullet or 700. Anything else? That's what I think. I'm prepared to be sorely mistaken, but we about to find out. All right, this is not who it was. This is me. Survey says 1971 versus 1928. Gotta be bullet, right? What? This was a blitz game? Nah, bro. Nah. No chance, bro. That was so bad. Nah. Wow. There is hope for all of you. That's insane. How did 219. Hundreds. Miss C takes b two also. What is this? What is this? What is this? Oh, lord. Okay, the good news is I didn't think they were 700 because of the Gotham sub. But I don't even. I mean, that's. Wow. Wow, that's. Oh, sorry. Yeah, the layout, the layout. My bad, my bad, my bad. Sorry, I haven't recorded in a while. I was just showing the queen moves in the opening. Oh, my goodness. That was horrendous. One of the worst things I've. Demon. Thank you for submitting that. That was sensational. And congratulations on hitting 1900. You're a beast. That was not the best day at the office. You all got to get the 1900 now, man. Wow, that was intense. What a game. Oh, big respect. Big respect. And if I ever guess that you're 700, I mean, and you're 19, just, you know, just take it just one. One day at a time. One day at a time. So one, a long time ago, a 2000 rated player got into guess the elo. And I guessed that they were like 1200. And they quit chess that day. And sometimes to this day, I think about them and I was like. I didn't even say anything insulting. I just was like, this was not a good. And they got so upset. Crazy. Showed chess dot com's opinion. Oh, yeah. Let me do that real quick. Chess dot com's opinion. Chess dot com's opinion. Chess.com thinks. Thinks 1150. Ah, wow. Sensational. 1150. All right, that was good. It could have been worse. Yeah, it really could have. All right, Gotham subbed this game with the blank pieces. White's playing a three pawn. Yeah, this is not any good because you can play like c five and you'll just get rid of the blockade very, very quickly. But, yeah, this is not a good move because you're justifying this. If you play d five here, you don't quite understand why you're playing the modern. It's to undermine the center. Knight c six and so on. This is just not an accurate move. You can use stockfish here. Not during the game, but it'll very quickly show you how to get a good position. But. Okay, d five. Yeah. You blocked your own bishop from the opening. It's giving three digit elo vibes. But honestly, from the last game, I would say this is 2100. Maybe that's. Is this going on YouTube? That joke is old, bro. They asked me that in the last guess, the elo. And then I said, it's not. And then everyone in the YouTube comments was like, he said, it's not. I can't do the same joke twice. Come on. Come on, bro. All right, this is bad. First of all, bishop checks like this, you really should block with pawns if you can and then get your development. But why'd you lose the. Maybe this was a mouse lip. Maybe they meant b five. They might have meant b five. Okay. E six. Oh, okay. Well, now black's just. Okay, H six. Black really just. What was that? Bro needs a new mouse. Bro. What? What's going on? White is playing really well. Black is playing well, too. Kind of. Knight G four is a losing move. Apparently, that's the top engine move because you go c four next, and you trap the bishop and there's no attack. If knight f six, you can just take play. Knight of five, take the bishop. Wow. Okay, that doesn't happen. Instead, white, black takes and doesn't trap the bishop. White is still trying to attack. Kick out the queen, hit the bishop. That's the top engine move. That's also the top engine move. What is this game? Dude, that's also the top engine move. That's also the top. Well, it was a fork. That was simple. Oh, my God. White is just. Okay. Rook C seven. And black is just marching white down. Oh, my God. Wait, why did he play Rook C seven? What? What even is this move? Just a waiting move. Oh. Rook B seven is the idea. But then this is what is. Oh, my God. He killed him. Whoa. You can't take that. It's pinned. Whoa. What even is this? Whoa. Brilliant move. Rook C three. Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. Why was this brilliant? Why was this a brilliant move, then? This is the dumbest brilliant move I've ever seen in my life. This is the follow up to get the bishop off, king off the diet. Shut up. Shut up. Oh, my God. Now white's. Oh, my gosh. White's not white. Oh, white is back in the game. What is going on? Oh, he lost everything. Damn it. It looked good. For a second, it actually was equal, and then White lost everything and probably lost the game. Okay, that was one of the strangest games I've ever seen. The opening was not good. Bishop B five is a bad move. Then they lost the pawn. It might have been a mouse lip, though. So I'm going to err on the side of mouse lip. And then the middle game was fine. The middle game was honestly pretty good. Queen d. I mean, this move alone got me thinking, like 1800, man. Like, really? I'm gonna say 1800. I'm gonna say 1800. Speed game. I actually don't know, but that's what I think. I mean, the quality was just way too high. A thousand. A thousand. A thousand. A thousand. A 1000. 10010. Zero. That's crazy. That is ridiculous. A 1000 rated player played queen to d four. That is utterly ridiculous. I thought it was an 1800 game with low time later. I mean, that is. Oh, my God. That's nuts. You have a coach, you're a thousand. I don't care if you have a coach. You're a 1000. That's a ridiculous move for a 1000 to play. Oh, my goodness. Come on, guys. I just guessed 1000 for that other game or whatever. 1500. It was a 2000 game, I guess. 1800. You're 1000. I mean, this is going to be the most stupid guess elo yet. Oh, God. I mean, Magnus Carlson wouldn't have found that. No, I think he would have. But I mean, good lord. Chess dot com's opinion. I think chess.com is going to agree with me. Let's see. Chess.com. I said 1800. Oh, shut up. Oh, shut up. Chess.com. Shut up. You know nothing, idiot. I'm the real guest. Elo king, stupid. 900. Shut up, man. Whatever. I don't even care. All right, normal. E four. E five. Finally. Okay. D four. Good stuff. Now white is just much better in the opening. Oh, fantastic. This is great. Develop the knight. Why y'all do this, man? Develop the knight before the bishop. You don't know that the bishop wants to go here. You don't know. The bishop could go there or there or there. Develop the knight first. Okay, that's not a bad move. All right, trading a lot. Oh, you got to have something here like 95 and queen h five. That's looking mighty juicy. Thank you for the gifted subs. I don't really know for what, but I appreciate it. Okay. Queen e two is not a terrible move, but 95 is way more forcing. White could have capitalized on the advantage a little bit more. White could have, for example, in this position, white could have already gone d five. And anytime your opponents play like this, it's an opportunity for you to rip open the center so you have opportunities to do something like queen d four, which is just fatal. Right. Okay. Which makes me think like a standard 1100. Game. Take, take. Good move. Yeah. White is going to win because of this pawn. Like, that's it. White is going to win because of the pawn. Okay, that was free. I don't know why we didn't take that. Probably didn't see it. Oh, there it is. Okay, nice. Good, heavy piece. Endgame. Okay. Oh, discovered. Oh, you know what? You know, there's a really nice move here. There's a really nice move. White to play and win. White to play and win. D seven, check. Exactly. D seven. Take the empty square. Rook f seven. Brutal move. Rook f seven, check. Damn, I didn't realize the rook becomes a bishop. Yeah, you're checking the queen. And the point is, this is mate. That's the very important to detail to see there because of the pin. So rook f seven is a very nice move. And if the queen has got a skedaddle, and then you can play rook f eight and e seven, probably. Or maybe just e seven. Yeah, because this is not mate. Why not? Because it's illegal. However, if you promote to a knight, this is mate and you lose. Stupid. So white played f three. White didn't do that, of course. And now white is just. Yeah, super simple. Just advance the. Just advance the pawn. Yeah. Wow. That's it? That's the whole game. Okay, well, I predict white is like 700. I feel like 700 submit games like this that they play where they destroy people and then they want me to say, like 2000. I've been here before where a low rated player plays. It was a good game. It was a very well played game. The only mistakes that White made were just not taking advantage of certain mistakes. 1300, you think? No, definitely not. 1300, I think like 807. 800. Because the opening understanding was very limited. I mean, white sort of just knew they have to go here. This is a bad move because you're just not supposed to double your pawns. You should be developing your knights before your bishops. White chasing the bishop is pretty indicative of maybe 8900. I think closer to 900. I think a lot of control was. It was demonstrated. Oh, well, okay, well, in my defense, and this is what I'm going to say in my defense, I did not think I did. Okay, in my defense, it was a very good game. I just didn't think a 1700 would submit a game like that. In my defense, I just really didn't think, you know, I. I just thought a 1700 just would be like, yeah, whatever. So you played really well. I just thought you were a low rated player that was proud of their game. The quality of the game was very high. It was very high game. The honest truth. Okay, if we analyze this objectively, somebody just donated $5 and you want me to rate your game. And you called me Levi and you donated and you put the game link, my friend. Do you have any idea what we are in the middle of? We are in the middle of a YouTube recording that we are doing guests. We've been doing it for about 20. How many minutes? About 25 minutes now. YouTube. This is the stuff we got to deal with. I understand you're excited and you bought a Carl Concourse and you want to share it. It's not the time right now. You can't just rush the stage during know. We'll do it after. This is the wrong time, wrong place. Now it's going to get on YouTube. Now you're going to show your friends. You're going to show them gotham, make fun of my donation. And you called me Levi. I mean, you literally committed the worst sin. My name is four letters. You got 75% of the name. You know what happens if you get 75% of your things right in school? Nothing. You just get A-C-I would know. Got a c in biology honors. I hated that class. Okay, so, first of all, let's game review. This game is your profile photo. Somebody getting banned? Wait a minute. 1550. I was going to say the actual quality of this game was around 13 1400. And allow me to explain my reasoning. Okay, yes. I'm backpedaling 100%. This is a bad move. This is a complete misunderstanding of this opening. Okay. No. 16 1700 should be playing this move. No. 16 1700 should be giving you a position also. Can I just say, no. 16 1700 is playing bishop to b four. This is a terrible move. Like, this is a terrible move. I mean, it's just a target for, like, of course, you just go here, and then you played. Well, you did a couple of things I didn't like. For example, I thought 15 1600 would find this in queen h five. Like, I thought it was just a very natural tactic, but, okay, it's life. And I just. In poker, you do a read, and my read was, you were a low rated player who was very proud of this game, and it turns out you were 1700. So I apologize. And these things happen in the words of philosopher g. Easy. All right, next game. Oh, my goodness. Okay. Wow. Vienna. Yes. Good to be back. Good to be back. There it is. This is completely inexcusable. I'd like to mention something right now. I know I talk about my courses a lot because I'm very proud of them. And I think that if you want to spend any money on chess improvement, my courses are the best way to go, especially if you're below, like, 17 1800. This is not even paid content. This is free. I offer this part of the e four course 100% free. You go to my website, you go to the e four course. The entire free sample covers this, and you don't even take the night. I have a question for you. Is it worse to not even take the night, or is it worse to take the night and then lose the queen? I think it's worse to not even take the night because you never even gave it a shot. You could literally do it 100% free. You could do it 100% for free. And y'all still don't take the night? Man. Oh, my goodness. How much is the course? Go look it up. Why are you asking? Go look. Go look. It takes you 10 seconds, you lazy koala. Some of you are koalas, man. You know what koalas do? Koalas starve to death while sitting next to the thing they eat. Stop having a smooth brain. Okay, take it. Take the pawn. Okay, if this is not a triple elo game, if this is a quadruple elo, if there are four numbers in either of these players. Elo. I'm hitting. Delete twitch channel, bro. Thank you. Thank you, Castle. Beautiful. Now we're back to business. Rugby one. Okay, what is this? Why are we playing top engine moves now? 95. There. It was even better because of. But fine. 95. Okay, makes sense. Take on h six. How the what? How do you even. Oh, amazing. No, come on. Take with the bishop. Take with the. Yes. No. Why'd you lose the night for no reason? Don't take the night. Okay, it's check. It's check. Okay, he finds it. It's found. Oh, but now black is still doing pretty well. What? You lost the rook? Oh, the rook. Oh, the rook is hanging. You could take that with you. Could what? Pawn push. Oh, king d six. No, king d six. Oh, God. Oh, this is insane. Oh, discover check. Yo, bro. He didn't take the rook. He didn't take the rook. I thought it was a discover check to win the rook, but he thought it was a discover check to give a mate on the back rank. And even if this rook wasn't there to take the rook, it wouldn't be a mate because of king e seven. And then you don't have a checkmate. Oh, no. Oh, he found it. Finally. Oh, Jesus. Oh, that's it. The game ended. The game is over. The game is over. I. Guys, there's another game after this. This is not the last game of guest the elo. We have another game. I 500. Gotta be like five. Yeah. Lit. Lit. I. The good news is, this is a curable condition. If you show up to the chess hospital and these are your symptoms, very easily treatable. This is called early onset ugaism. Okay? And you go caveman brain for a little bit. Or cavewoman. We don't want to discriminate. Okay. You can cure a lot of this by just solving puzzles and doing a little bit, just a little bit of study. So I'm going to say a solid high 400. And if you're anything higher than that, if you're in the four digits, the good news is you are not four digits. The bad news is you are 677 and 717. And was this game recently played? And what. What does chess.com think? It thinks you're. Oh, damn. Oh, my God. Oh, damn. Okay, well, look, here's the good news? Here's the good news. You can't go any lower than that, right? So even at your bottom, you won. I think. Did you win? You lost. Oh, God. Oh. I'm trying to find the positives. The good news is you're from a great country that is very beautiful and has a lot of islands and a fantastic diet. And the good news is you're probably going to live to about 100 because the mediterranean diet is a good thing. Saving grace. Look at your messages. Yes, I saw them. Subscribers sometimes check my profile. Please. I've gained 400 points. Oh, there's a happy ending after all. Not that kind. Oh, wow. Your name is achillia. Wow, what a cool name. 1023. Okay. To that, I say, well done. If you can go from that to plus 300, that is character improvement. We like that. You know what? I'm just going to say this right now. This next game of guest, the Elo, will never be what this game was. I'm very sorry that you have a very tough act to follow after that, but that was a ridiculous game. Wow. Just wow games. Okay. D four. C six. This is what we call a Carl Khan Fiend. So some people are addicted to their phones. Some people are addicted to alcohol. That's not good. To drugs. God forbid. Some people are addicted to the Karo Khan. I was actually one of these people a long time. I used to play this and I would play the slav like this. What did you say? You had a tournament recently and you won a trophy? Can I thank you? What am I thanking you for? You should be thanking me. Shouldn't I be congratulating you? What am I thanking you for? Thank you for winning the tournament. Thank you, I guess. Congratulations. It's huge. Congrats. I mean, did you win, like, an impressive tournament or did you show up? I walk by the soccer field sometimes, football field, and I see five year olds, and I tell my wife, like, I'd go smoke them right now. I'd score on all of them. They're trash. But they're five. You know what I mean? I destroy a field of five year olds in football. I mean, I'm much better than them. But if you go to a tournament and you beat a bunch of five year olds, beating kids is fun. Okay, night of f in chess. This is not the right move. You're supposed to play e six. Okay? You played e six. A little later, okay? This is the Gotham subcarrow. You're just losing now. E six is just. Yeah. You're. Yep. Oh, that's insane. I can't believe you saw that. Wow. What? Okay, that's not a good move. There was no need to play that. You got to make progress in the position. I like to tell you all. Eight times out of ten, the best move is not going backwards. What? Take with a pawn? What did they do? They thought night before. Oh, God. King B eight. Get out of the pin. Get out of the pin. Get out of the pin. King b eight. Oh, my God. Play the move. King to b eight. Play. Fine. You don't have to do anything. Don't. Don't listen to me. You have a mate somehow. Where's a mate? Rook H one. Rook H one. Rook C one. Nice take on e six. Okay, so this was just a murder. You just committed a murder in this game. That's what you did. I mean, it was a fun game kind of, for you. I don't know what you're doing with the bishop, but okay. And I'm assuming you won on time here. I'm assuming that's what happened. Is that. Is that. Well, the good news is game four delivered. The bad news is game five was a bit boring, but this was, again, another very well played game. I would not rush with the move f six in the Carl Khan, but you made it work. You almost played a perfect opening, by the way. I mean, night before is a ridiculous move. Night before is to play night a six. Night before. It's really clever. Really, really clever. Oh, you're game three. Oh, Chad. Boss man. Well, I'm sorry I called you 700. Yeah. I'm going to say, like 1300. I'm gonna say like 1300. I'm gonna say twelve. 1300. That. That's. That's what I'm saying. And I'm saying it. And I'm saying it and I'm saying. 1200. A grand master. Oh, my God. Oh, my. I'm done, bro. That is. Is the stupid. This was the stupidest episode of guest the elo I have ever seen. You guys can entertain yourselves. I'm good.
